# Keyboard Shortcuts

Reference for key bindings in the Grok Build TUI. Bindings are built in and cannot currently be remapped.

---

## Input Modes

Grok has two input modes that control how you navigate the scrollback:

- **Simple mode** (default): Arrow keys for navigation, `Shift+Arrow` for turn navigation, `Space` to focus the prompt, and any letter key auto-focuses the prompt.
- **Vim mode** (opt-in): `j`/`k` for navigation, `H`/`L` for turn navigation, `J`/`K` for response navigation, `h`/`l` for fold, `e`/`E` for expand/collapse, and `i`/`Tab`/`Space` to focus the prompt.

Simple mode is active by default. To switch to Vim mode, set `vim_mode = true` under `[ui]` in `~/.grok/config.toml`, or toggle it at runtime with `/vim-mode`. See [Configuration](05-configuration.md) for details.

The tables below document bindings for both modes. The "Key" column shows the Vim-mode binding, and the "Alt Key" column shows the equivalent in simple mode (arrow keys, etc.).

> **Vim-mode required**: Single-letter and `Shift+letter` bindings in the
> **Scrollback** context (`j/k`, `h/l`, `g/G`, `L/H`, `y/Y`, `o/O`, `r`,
> `x`, `e/E`, and the `i` insert-mode alt) require `[ui].vim_mode = true`
> in `~/.grok/config.toml` (or `/vim-mode` to toggle). Arrow keys, `Tab`,
> `Esc`, `Space`, `PageUp/Down`, and every `Ctrl+letter` shortcut work in
> both modes.

---

## Navigation (Scrollback Focused)

Move through conversation entries in the scrollback pane.

| Key | Alt Key | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `j` | `Down` | Select next entry |
| `k` | `Up` | Select previous entry |
| `⇧L` | `Shift+Right` | Jump to next turn (user prompt) |
| `⇧H` | `Shift+Left` | Jump to previous turn (user prompt) |
| `⇧J` | | Jump to next assistant response |
| `⇧K` | | Jump to previous assistant response |
| `g` | | Go to top of scrollback |
| `⇧G` | | Go to bottom of scrollback |
| `Ctrl+K` | | Scroll up one line (without changing selection) |
| `Ctrl+J` | | Scroll down one line (without changing selection) |
| `PageUp` | | Scroll up one page |
| `PageDown` | | Scroll down one page |
| `Ctrl+U` | | Scroll up half page |
| `Ctrl+D` (`Shift+D` in VSCode) | | Scroll down half page |

`PageUp` and `PageDown` also scroll the conversation while the ordinary prompt
is focused, without moving focus or changing the draft. An active prompt
history, `@` file search, slash menu, or completion dropdown keeps the keys for
its own navigation.

---

## View (Scrollback Focused)

Control how entries are displayed in the scrollback.

| Key | Alt Key | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `h` | `Left` | Collapse selected entry |
| `l` | `Right` | Expand selected entry |
| `e` | | Toggle fold on selected entry |
| `⇧E` | | Expand all / collapse all entries |
| `Ctrl+E` | | Expand/collapse all thinking blocks |
| `r` | | Toggle raw markdown on selected entry |

Setting `respect_manual_folds = true` under `[scrollback.scroll]` in
`pager.toml` (opt-in, off by default — see
[Configuration](05-configuration.md)) makes a hand-folded block pinned:
streaming updates and finish events (for example a thinking block ending)
leave it alone instead of resetting it, and expanding a block while
auto-scroll is following the tail stops following so you can read; resume
with `⇧G`, `j` at the last entry, scrolling past the bottom, or sending a new
prompt. `⇧E` clears all pins, and `Ctrl+E` clears pins on thinking blocks.

### Block Content

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `y` | Copy block content to clipboard |
| `⇧Y` | Copy block metadata (e.g., the shell command) to clipboard |
| `Enter` | Open block content in fullscreen viewer |
| `Ctrl+F` | Open block content in fullscreen viewer (alt binding) |

---

## Focus

Switch between the prompt input and scrollback pane.

| Key | Alt Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|---------|--------|
| `Tab` | `Space` (and `i` in vim mode) | Scrollback focused | Focus the prompt input |
| `Tab` | | Prompt focused | Focus the scrollback (both simple and vim scrollback modes) |
| `Enter` | | Prompt focused | Send the current prompt |

**Esc is not a focus key.** It follows clear / rewind semantics below (and swallows mid-turn), independent of `[ui].simple_mode` (prompt editor) and `[ui].vim_mode` (scrollback nav). Overlays, modals, slash/file dropdowns, voice, search, and selection still steal Esc first.

## Escape

| State | Gesture | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Turn running | `Esc` | Swallowed no-op (does **not** cancel). Use `Ctrl+C` (or palette / other cancel entry points). |
| Turn cancelling | `Esc` | Re-sends cancel (retry if the first ack was lost). `Ctrl+C` in this state escalates toward quit. |
| Idle + non-empty prompt (text or image chips), **prompt focused** | **2× `Esc` within 800ms** | Clear the prompt; non-empty text is saved to prompt history. First press shows “press again to clear”. |
| Idle + empty prompt + conversation messages, **prompt or scrollback focused** | **2× `Esc` within 800ms** | Open the rewind picker (same as `/rewind`). First press is silent (no toast). |
| Idle + empty + no messages, **or scrollback focused with a draft / moded (`!` `#` feedback) composer / pending needs-input overlay / open history search** | `Esc` | Swallowed no-op (does not focus scrollback). Clear is prompt-pane only; rewind requires an empty Normal-mode composer, no pending overlay, and no open history search — reading the scrollback never mutates your draft, your composer mode, a question awaiting an answer, or an in-progress search. |

**Steal-Esc (runs before mid-turn swallow / clear / rewind):** overlays, modals, slash/file/completion dropdowns, history search, scrollback search, text selection, link highlight, voice, and **Bash / Remember / Feedback mode exit** when the prompt is empty (Esc leaves `!` / `#` / feedback mode and returns to the normal prompt — even while a turn is running).

**Ctrl+C vs Esc:** with a non-empty draft while a turn is running, Ctrl+C clears the draft and keeps the turn; a second Ctrl+C on an empty prompt cancels. Esc does not cancel a running turn (only retries while already cancelling). Idle non-empty Ctrl+C clears in one press; Esc requires two presses within 800ms.

## Agent-Level

Actions that affect the agent session, available from the agent screen.

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl+P` | Agent screen | Open the command palette |
| `?` (Shift+/) | Agent screen | Open the command palette (alt binding) |
| `Ctrl+M` | Agent screen | Open the model picker / switch model |
| `Ctrl+M` | Prompt focused | Toggle multiline input mode |
| `Ctrl+C` | Agent screen | Cancel the current turn (or clear non-empty draft first; see Escape table) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Agent screen | Toggle always-approve (YOLO) mode |
| `Ctrl+S` | Agent screen | Open the session picker (resume a previous session) |
| `Ctrl+;` (alt: `Ctrl+'`) | Agent screen | Toggle the prompt queue pane (when non-empty). **Local macOS** VS Code family only: primary **`Ctrl+4`** (`;` / `'` still alts). SSH and non-Mac keep **`Ctrl+;`** / **`Ctrl+'`**. |
| `Shift+Tab` | Prompt focused | Cycle mode (Normal → Plan → Always-approve) |
| `Ctrl+G` | Agent screen | Send the current task to the background |
| `Ctrl+T` | Agent screen | Toggle the todos pane |
| `Ctrl+B` | Agent screen | Toggle the tasks pane |
| `Ctrl+L` | Agent screen | Open the extensions modal (**non–VS Code family only**; on VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Zed, `Ctrl+L` is mid-turn **interject** and extensions open via `/plugins` / `/hooks`) |
| `↑` | Prompt focused (empty prompt, normal input mode) | Open the history panel with your last prompt filled in; `↑`/`↓` step through entries (each lands in the input), `↓` at the newest closes the panel, and typing edits the recalled prompt in place. Recalled `!` shell commands re-enter shell mode. `↓` never opens history. |
| `!` | Prompt focused | Enter shell mode (type `!` on an empty prompt) |
| `Ctrl+.` (alt: `Ctrl+X`) | Agent screen | Open the keyboard shortcuts help |
| `F2` (alt: `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`) | Agent screen | Open the settings modal |

**Note:** `Ctrl+M` is context-dependent. When the prompt is focused, it toggles multiline input mode. Otherwise, it opens the model picker.

**Note:** `Ctrl+'` is a Windows alt for `Ctrl+;` — some Windows consoles drop the `Ctrl` modifier on punctuation keys.

**Note:** `Ctrl+.` needs the Kitty keyboard protocol (or tmux `extended-keys on` so that protocol can pass through). On VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf / Zed integrated terminals, VTE, Apple Terminal, Windows Terminal, JetBrains, tmux with `extended-keys off`, screen, and similar no-KKP setups, Grok advertises **`Ctrl+X`** as the primary shortcuts-cheatsheet key instead. **`Ctrl+X` always works** as a classic control character even when `Ctrl+.` does not. Run `/terminal-setup` if modified keys misbehave in tmux.

## Image Paste & Drag-and-Drop

| Action | macOS | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drag image from file manager into the prompt | Finder ✓ | Files / Dolphin ✓ | Explorer ✓ |
| Copy a file in the file manager, then paste | `Cmd+V` | `Ctrl+V` | `Ctrl+V` |
| Screenshot or "Copy Image" in clipboard, then paste | `Cmd+V` | `Ctrl+V` | **`Alt+V`** |

Non-image files insert their absolute path as text instead of a chip.

> **`Alt+V` on Windows** is grok-specific. Windows Terminal's default `Ctrl+V` only pastes plain text and silently drops image clipboards; `Alt+V` bypasses the interceptor. To use `Ctrl+V` for images too, add `{ "command": null, "keys": "ctrl+v" }` to `actions` in your Windows Terminal `settings.json`.

### Linux PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD

Linux X11 has two independent text selections:

- `Ctrl+V` reads **CLIPBOARD**, the explicit copy/cut selection. It never falls back to PRIMARY. To put text there with `xclip`, use `printf %s "text" | xclip -selection clipboard`.
- An unmodified middle click in Grok reads **PRIMARY**, the current mouse selection, only when `DISPLAY` is non-empty. Pure X11 can use its native reader fallback; XWayland requires `xclip` or `xsel` on `PATH` so Grok reads the X11 selection rather than Wayland PRIMARY. The press is handled once; the release does not paste again.
- `Shift+Insert` is the terminal-native way to paste selected text. Many terminals also use `Shift+middle click` to bypass application mouse reporting.

Over SSH, the remote Grok process usually cannot access the terminal's local X11 selection. Use terminal-native `Shift+Insert` or `Shift+middle click` so the local terminal sends the selected text through the PTY.

## During an active turn (agent running)

While the agent is generating:

- **Plain `Enter`** (with text in the composer) **queues** a follow-up for later. Queued follow-ups run after the current turn ends — and they deliberately **hold** while the agent is blocked waiting on background tasks or a subagent (a hint explains the hold and how to send one now).
- **`Enter` again on the emptied composer** (double-Enter) sends the **top** queued follow-up now.
- The **send now** chord is **cancel-and-send**: it stops the current turn (background tasks, subagents, and the rest of the queue keep running) and sends your message as the next turn, so it always appears at the bottom of the transcript:
  - **Non-empty composer** → cancel and send that text now.
  - **Empty composer** + a queued follow-up → send the **top** queued follow-up now (no need to focus the queue pane). On the queue pane, the same chord (or the **[Send now]** button) sends the **selected** row.
  - **Idle**, or **empty composer with nothing queued** → no-op for that key.
- While the agent is **blocked waiting** (on task output or a subagent), plain `Enter` with text also delivers immediately — the shell cancels the blocked turn and runs your message next.

| Terminal | Primary | Alternates | Action |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Default | `Ctrl+Enter` | `Ctrl+I` | Send now (cancels the current turn, runs your message next) |
| Apple Terminal | `Ctrl+O` | `Ctrl+Enter`, `Ctrl+I` | Send now |
| VS Code family (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed) | **`Ctrl+L`** | *(none)* | Send now (`Ctrl+I` not used — Tab / host chat; plugins via `/plugins`) |

In `/multiline` mode, `Shift+Enter` (or `Alt+Enter`) sends while plain `Enter` inserts a newline. (`Ctrl+Enter` is send-now mid-turn when bound on non–VS Code family; it does not submit a new idle turn.)

Send-now is intentionally interruptive — it reads as "stop what you're doing and take this". To hand the agent a note **without** stopping it, queue with plain `Enter`; the agent picks it up at the next turn boundary.

> **WezTerm**: These modified Enter keys need `enable_kitty_keyboard = true` in your WezTerm config. Full steps and a one-line workaround are in the [terminal support guide](21-terminal-support.md#problem-ctrlenter-doesnt-interject-in-wezterm).

> **Windows (non–VS Code family)**: Some consoles drop the `Ctrl` modifier on `Ctrl+Enter` (it can collapse to bare `Enter` or `Ctrl+J`). Use `Ctrl+I` as the alt — letter-key Ctrl chords are stable everywhere. On VS Code family, use **`Ctrl+L`**.

> **VS Code family `Ctrl+L`**: Grok uses it for interject and leaves the extensions shortcut unbound (open plugins with `/plugins` or the command palette). If your terminal profile still maps **Clear** (or another command) to `Ctrl+L`, that host binding can steal the chord — rebind or remove it so the PTY receives form feed (`\x0c`).

## Global

Actions available from any screen.

| Key | Alt Key | Action | Confirmation |
|-----|---------|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+N` | | Create a new session (optionally in a git worktree) | Yes (double-press within 1000ms) |
| `Ctrl+Q` | `Ctrl+D` | Quit the application | Yes (double-press within 1000ms) |

**VS Code family terminal** (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed integrated terminals): `Ctrl+Q` is captured by the host, so Grok makes **`Ctrl+D` the sole quit key** (`Ctrl+Q` is not bound). Half-page-down is rebound to bare **`Shift+D`**. Mid-turn interject uses **`Ctrl+L`** (no alternates) because `Ctrl+Enter` / `Ctrl+I` do not reliably reach the PTY; extensions are opened via `/plugins` instead of `Ctrl+L`.

> **Returning to the welcome screen has no key binding** — use the `/home` slash command (alias `/welcome`) from inside a session. See [Slash Commands](04-slash-commands.md).

### Destructive Action Confirmation

Actions marked with "Yes" in the confirmation column require a double-press within 1000ms. Press the key once to see a confirmation prompt, then press again to confirm. This prevents accidental session loss.

---

## Welcome Screen

Bindings that only fire on the welcome screen (before any agent session is open).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+S` | Resume session (open the session picker) |
| `Ctrl+W` | Open the New Worktree dialog (only inside a git repository) |
| `Ctrl+I` | Import Claude settings (when available) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+I` | Dismiss the Claude import row (when available) |

`Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+I`, and `Ctrl+Shift+I` are only active on the welcome screen. `Ctrl+S` opens the session picker on both the welcome screen and inside an agent session (where it opens as a modal overlay, same as the `/resume` command). `Ctrl+Q` is the same global Quit binding documented above, not a welcome-specific handler.

---

## Command Palette

Press `Ctrl+P` or `?` to open the command palette -- a searchable list of actions. The palette shows:

- All keyboard shortcuts with their current bindings
- All slash commands
- Available skills

Type to filter, then press `Enter` to execute the selected action.

---

## Shortcuts Bar

The bottom of the TUI displays a contextual shortcuts bar showing the most relevant key bindings for the current state. The hints change based on:

- Which pane is focused (scrollback vs. prompt)
- Whether the agent is currently running
- What type of entry is selected

---

## Mouse Support

The TUI supports mouse interaction:

- **Click** on a scrollback entry to select it
- **Scroll wheel** to scroll through the scrollback
- **Click** on the prompt area to focus it
- **Hover** over the prompt to see a highlight (configurable via `pager.toml`)
- **Middle click** on Linux X11/XWayland to paste the PRIMARY selection

---

## Quick Reference Card

### When scrollback is focused (Simple mode — default)

```
Navigation:       Up/Down (prev/next entry)  Shift+Left/Right (prev/next turn)
Scrolling:        Ctrl+J/K (line)  PgUp/PgDn (page)  Ctrl+U/D (half page)
Focus prompt:     Space or any letter key (auto-focuses and types)
```

### When scrollback is focused (Vim mode)

```
Navigation:       j/k (up/down)  H/L (prev/next turn)  K/J (prev/next response)  g/G (top/bottom)
Scrolling:        Ctrl+J/K (line)  Ctrl+U/D (half page; D=Shift+D in VSCode)  PgUp/PgDn (page)
Folding:          h/l (collapse/expand)  e (toggle)  E (all)
Content:          y (copy)  Y (copy cmd)  Enter (fullscreen)
View:             r (raw markdown)  Ctrl+E (thinking)
Focus prompt:     i, Tab, or Space
```

### When prompt is focused

```
Send:             Enter
Newline:          Shift+Enter or Alt+Enter
Multiline:        Ctrl+M (toggle)
Paste:            Ctrl+V (text, files, screenshots on macOS/Linux)
Selected text:    Middle click or Shift+Insert (Linux X11/XWayland PRIMARY)
Paste image:      Alt+V (Windows only — for screenshots / "Copy Image")
Select all:       Cmd+A (macOS, Ghostty only — see note below)
Leave:            Tab (back to scrollback)
Cancel (running): Ctrl+C (empty prompt; non-empty draft clears first)
Clear (idle):     Esc Esc within 800ms (non-empty prompt)
Rewind (idle):    Esc Esc within 800ms (empty prompt + messages)
```

> **Cmd+A is gated to Ghostty.** Grok's in-app `Cmd+A` handler is only
> wired up when the detected terminal is Ghostty. Other terminals
> either swallow `Cmd+A` at the terminal layer (Apple Terminal, default
> iTerm2) or apply their own in-terminal "Select All" behaviour (Kitty,
> WezTerm). On a non-Ghostty terminal, the binding does nothing and the
> key falls through to the terminal's native behaviour.
>
> On Ghostty, add the one-line unbind to `~/.config/ghostty/config` so
> the keystroke reaches the running TUI:
>
> ```ini
> keybind = cmd+a=unbind
> ```
>
> After Ghostty reloads (it watches the config file), `Cmd+A` in the
> prompt selects every character in the prompt buffer, including pasted
> image chips. Image chips are always path-free (`[Image #N]`); the
> filepath (when known) appears only in the image preview overlay on
> hover or when the cursor is on/right after the chip.

### Always available
