# Sandbox Mode

Sandbox mode restricts what the agent process and its spawned commands can access on your filesystem and network using OS-level kernel primitives (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS). The kernel enforces these limits for the process lifetime.

Sandbox mode is off by default.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run with workspace sandbox (read everywhere, write to CWD + temp dirs + ~/.grok/)
grok --sandbox workspace

# Read-only mode (read everywhere, write only to ~/.grok/ + temp dirs)
grok --sandbox read-only

# Most restrictive profile (read CWD + system paths, write CWD + temp dirs + ~/.grok/, no child network)
grok --sandbox strict
```

## Built-in Profiles

| Profile               | FS Read            | FS Write                                       | Child Network | Use Case                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `off` (default)       | Unrestricted       | Unrestricted                                   | Unrestricted  | No sandbox                        |
| `workspace`           | Everywhere         | CWD + `~/.grok/` + `/tmp` + `/var/tmp`         | Allowed       | Normal development                |
| `devbox`              | Everywhere         | All top-level dirs except `/data`              | Allowed       | Disposable dev VMs                |
| `read-only`           | Everywhere         | `~/.grok/` + `/tmp` + `/var/tmp`               | Blocked¹      | Exploration, code review          |
| `strict`              | CWD + system paths | CWD + `~/.grok/` + `/tmp` + `/var/tmp`         | Blocked¹      | Untrusted code                    |

¹ Child-network blocking is enforced on **Linux only** (via seccomp). On macOS it is a no-op — these profiles do not restrict child-process network there.

To block specific files (e.g. `.env` or credential paths) on top of a profile, define a [custom profile](#custom-profiles) with a `deny` list — it is kernel-enforced (read + write/rename) and supports glob patterns like `**/*.pem`.

### Profile Details

**workspace** -- The recommended profile for everyday development. The agent can read any file on the system (for understanding dependencies, system libraries, etc.) but can only write to the current working directory, `~/.grok/`, and temp directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, plus the macOS temp dirs). Network access is allowed for tools like `web_search` and MCP servers.

**devbox** -- A reserved built-in profile for disposable development VMs. The agent can read everywhere and write to every top-level directory except `/data` and the virtual filesystems (`/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`), including the home directory. Network access is allowed. `--sandbox devbox` runs the built-in profile, which shadows any `[profiles.devbox]` you define in `sandbox.toml`.

**read-only** -- Use when you want the agent to analyze code without modifying your project files. The agent can read everything but can only write to `~/.grok/` (needed for session persistence) and temp directories. Child-process network access is blocked on Linux (no-op on macOS).

**strict** -- The most restrictive profile, for reviewing untrusted code. The agent can only read files within the current working directory and essential system paths. Writes are limited to CWD, `~/.grok/`, and temp directories. Child-process network access is blocked on Linux (no-op on macOS).

---

## Custom Profiles

Create custom sandbox profiles in `~/.grok/sandbox.toml` (global) or `.grok/sandbox.toml` (per-project):

```toml
[profiles.project]
# Start from a built-in profile, then add overrides
extends = "workspace"
restrict_network = true

# Paths the agent can read but NOT write/delete
read_only = ["/data"]

# Additional writable paths
read_write = ["/tmp/scratch"]

# Paths or globs to kernel-deny (read + write/rename, enforced; see notes below)
deny = ["/data/shared-secrets", "**/.env", "**/*.pem"]
```

Use the custom profile:

```bash
grok --sandbox project
```

A custom profile can't reuse a built-in name. `--sandbox devbox` always runs the built-in `devbox` profile, shadowing any `[profiles.devbox]` you define.

### Custom Profile Fields

| Field              | Type     | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `extends`          | String   | Base built-in profile to inherit from (`workspace`, `devbox`, `read-only`, `strict`). Defaults to `workspace` when omitted |
| `restrict_network` | Boolean  | Block network access for child processes             |
| `read_only`        | String[] | Additional read-only paths                           |
| `read_write`       | String[] | Additional read-write paths                          |
| `deny`             | String[] | Paths or globs to kernel-deny (read + write/rename; see notes). An entry with `*`, `?`, or `[` is a glob |

> **Note on `deny`:** A non-empty `deny` list is **kernel-enforced**. Denied paths
> are **read-denied and write/rename-denied** via Seatbelt on macOS and a bwrap
> bind-over on Linux, so a denied path can neither be read (via `bash`, `grep`, or
> subagents) nor relocated out of the deny set and read elsewhere (the
> `mv secret x && cat x` bypass is closed). On **Linux**, read-deny requires
> `bubblewrap`: if it is missing (or any single deny path can't be bound), Grok
> refuses to start rather than run with denied paths exposed (`devbox`, which only
> write-denies `/data`, still falls back to Landlock). Writes to paths **not** in
> `deny` are controlled by what you grant in `read_write`.

> **Globs in `deny`:** An entry is a **glob** if it contains `*`, `?`, or `[`.
> Those characters **always** mean glob — to deny a literal file whose name
> contains them, name a parent directory instead. The supported, gitignore-style
> subset is:
>
> - `*` — any run of characters within one path segment (stops at `/`)
> - `?` — exactly one character within a segment
> - `**` — spans directories (as a whole path segment, e.g. `**/`, `a/**`); `**/`
>   also matches zero directories, so `**/.env` matches `.env` and `sub/.env`
> - `[abc]` / `[a-z]` — character classes; a leading `!` **or** `^` negates
>   (`[!a]` and `[^a]` both mean "not `a`")
>
> Brace alternation (`{a,b}`), backslash-escapes, and the unusual class forms
> `[]…]` (literal `]` first) and POSIX `[[:…:]]` are **not** supported, so the two
> platforms can never interpret a glob differently. A glob using an unsupported
> metacharacter, or one that is malformed, makes Grok **refuse to start** (fail
> closed) on **both** platforms — write `*.pem` and `*.key` as separate entries
> rather than `*.{pem,key}`.
>
> Relative globs are anchored at the workspace; absolute globs (e.g.
> `/home/**/.ssh`) at their literal prefix. Non-glob entries keep exact-path
> matching. Enforcement otherwise differs by platform:
>
> - **macOS is airtight:** each glob becomes a Seatbelt regex applied at runtime,
>   so matching files are denied **even if created after Grok starts**.
> - **Linux is best-effort:** a mount namespace can't glob at runtime, so each
>   glob is expanded to the files that **exist at launch** and those are bound
>   over. Files created **later** that match a glob are **not** covered — name
>   exact paths for anything that must be airtight on Linux. A glob that matches
>   too many files, or whose tree is too deep/broad to walk, makes Grok **refuse
>   to start** rather than under-enforce.

## How It Works

The sandbox is applied to the **entire grok process** at startup using kernel primitives -- not per-command wrapping. This means all tool operations are covered:

- `read_file`, `search_replace`, `list_dir` -- restricted by Landlock/Seatbelt in-process
- `bash` commands, `grep` (rg) -- child processes inherit FS restrictions automatically
- Network -- on Linux, child processes can be blocked via seccomp; on macOS this is a no-op

The sandbox is **irreversible** once applied. The agent cannot relax restrictions at runtime.

---

## Resuming Sessions

The profile a session was started with is saved with the session and is **fixed
for the life of the session**. When you resume it (`grok --resume <id>`,
`grok --continue`, or `grok -r`), Grok restores that same profile automatically —
so a session started with `--sandbox workspace` won't silently come back under a
stricter default and break commands that previously worked.

Resuming will **not** change a session's sandbox:

- Omitting `--sandbox` on resume uses the session's saved profile.
- Passing `--sandbox <profile>` that **matches** the saved profile is allowed.
- Passing `--sandbox <profile>` that **differs** from the saved profile is
  **refused with an error** — changing a resumed session's sandbox is a safety
  footgun (it could widen access the session was meant to be confined to, or
  break a session that relied on broader access). Start a new session to use a
  different profile.

Profile resolution order for a **new** session:

1. An explicit `--sandbox <profile>` flag or `GROK_SANDBOX` environment variable
2. The `[sandbox] profile` in your config
3. `off` (no sandbox)

---

## Platform Support

| Platform | Mechanism | Minimum Version        |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Linux    | Landlock  | Kernel 5.13 or later   |
| macOS    | Seatbelt  | macOS (all versions)   |

If the sandbox cannot be applied (e.g., unsupported kernel, missing entitlements), Grok logs a warning and continues without enforcement. The exception is an explicitly-requested **custom profile**: on **both macOS and Linux**, if it cannot be applied (unknown profile, malformed `sandbox.toml`, or — on Linux — `bubblewrap` unavailable for a non-empty `deny`), Grok refuses to start rather than run with its denied paths exposed.

---

## Network Restrictions

On Linux, profiles with `restrict_network` block network access in **child processes** (bash commands, scripts) via seccomp. On macOS, network blocking is a no-op. Built-in tools that make HTTP requests in-process (web search, LLM API calls) are never affected -- the agent needs network access to function.

In practice, on Linux this means:

- `web_search`, `web_fetch`, and the LLM API always have network access
- `bash` commands like `curl`, `wget`, and `npm install` are blocked when `restrict_network` is enabled

---

## Event Logging

Sandbox events are logged to `~/.grok/sandbox-events.jsonl` for debugging. Events include:

- Profile applied (which profile, timestamp)
- Violations (attempted access to denied paths)

## When to Use Sandbox Mode

**Use `workspace` when:**

- Working on your own projects and you want basic write protection
- Running in shared environments where you want to limit the scope of changes

**Define a custom profile with a `deny` list when:**

- You need to block specific files (e.g. `.env` or credential paths) on top of a base profile
- You need kernel enforcement that covers `bash`, `grep`, and subagents — not just the `read_file` tool

**Use `read-only` when:**

- Reviewing code you do not trust
- Exploring a codebase without risk of accidental modification
- Running code analysis or audits

**Use `strict` when:**

- Analyzing untrusted or third-party code
- Running in security-sensitive environments
- You want maximum isolation

**Skip sandbox when:**

- The agent needs to install dependencies (`npm install`, `pip install`)
- The agent needs to modify files outside the working directory
- You are working in a trusted environment and want maximum flexibility

## Trade-offs

| Aspect      | Without Sandbox            | With Sandbox                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Safety      | Agent has full system access | Agent restricted to profile rules |
| Capability  | Can do anything            | Limited by profile              |
| Performance | No overhead                | Negligible overhead             |
| Recovery    | Must trust the agent       | Kernel enforces boundaries      |

The sandbox enforces limits at the OS level -- through Landlock or a mount namespace on Linux, and Seatbelt on macOS -- not a separate VM.
