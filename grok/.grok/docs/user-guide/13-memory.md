# Cross-Session Memory

Memory lets Grok recall facts, decisions, and patterns from earlier sessions. Grok indexes the information you save and searches it automatically, so a new session can reuse relevant context.

---

## What Is Memory?

Without memory, each Grok session starts fresh: the model knows nothing about previous sessions. When you enable memory, Grok can:

- Recall project conventions you explained before.
- Reuse debugging steps that worked.
- Carry architectural decisions forward across sessions.
- Avoid re-asking questions it already has answers to.

Memory is experimental and disabled by default.

---

## Enabling Memory

### Per-Session Flag

```bash
grok --experimental-memory
```

### Environment Variable

```bash
export GROK_MEMORY=1
grok
```

### Config File (Persistent)

```toml
# ~/.grok/config.toml
[memory]
enabled = true
```

### Force-Disable

To disable memory even when other settings enable it:

```bash
grok --no-memory
```

Or:

```bash
export GROK_MEMORY=0
```

The `--no-memory` flag has absolute highest priority and always disables memory.

### Mid-Session Toggle

Toggle memory on or off during a session without restarting:

```
/memory on
/memory off
```

The toggle is session-scoped -- it does not persist to `config.toml`. Toggling off removes access to memory tools but keeps existing files on disk. Toggling on re-initializes memory storage and registers the memory tools.

You can also toggle from inside the `/memory` modal by pressing `t`.

### Priority Order

1. `--no-memory` CLI flag (always disables)
2. `--experimental-memory` CLI flag (enables)
3. `GROK_MEMORY` env var: `1`/`true` enables, `0`/`false` disables
4. `[memory]` section in config.toml
5. Remote settings (server-side defaults)
6. Default: disabled

## How Memory Is Stored

Memory is stored as Markdown files under `~/.grok/memory/`:

| Location | Scope | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md` | Global | Facts that apply across all your projects |
| `~/.grok/memory/<project-slug>-<hash8>/MEMORY.md` | Workspace | Project-specific conventions and context |
| `~/.grok/memory/<project-slug>-<hash8>/sessions/` | Sessions | Per-session summaries and logs |

Grok suffixes each workspace directory with a short hash of the repository's identity. The identity is the `origin` remote in `org/repo` form when the directory is a Git repository with an `origin` remote, or the directory path otherwise. Because clones and worktrees of the same repository share an `origin` remote, they also share one memory directory.

An SQLite index supports hybrid search across all memory files:
- **FTS5** provides full-text search for keyword matching.
- **vec0** provides vector search for semantic similarity. Vector search is optional and requires an embedding.

---

## Automatic Saves

When a session ends, Grok saves a structured metadata summary to that session's daily log. The summary contains:

- Message counts (user, assistant, and tool results).
- Topics: the first few substantive user prompts from the session, up to five.
- The session date and time (UTC).

Grok builds the summary from conversation metadata without an LLM call, without added latency. Grok skips the save for trivial sessions -- those with fewer than three substantive prompts, or fewer than 50 bytes of user text.

The summary does not record tool usage, file paths, or shell commands. The session ID forms part of the log filename. To turn automatic saves off, set `session.save_on_end = false`. For richer capture of decisions, patterns, and reasoning, use `/flush`.

---

## Saving Rich Knowledge with /flush

For richer capture -- decisions, patterns, debugging workflows, API discoveries -- use `/flush` in the TUI:

```
/flush
```

This triggers an LLM-generated summary of the current session's most important content and writes it to a dated session log. The summary is indexed and searchable in future sessions.

Use `/flush` when you want to preserve important context:
- Before compaction (which discards old conversation turns)
- At the end of a productive debugging session
- After discovering important patterns or conventions

---

## Working with Memory

### Remember

Ask Grok to remember something, and it appends the note to a `MEMORY.md` file -- the workspace file for project-specific items, or the global `~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md` for cross-project preferences:

```
> remember to always open PR links after pushing
```

Grok records entries as durable statements under organized headings, such as `## Preferences`, `## Project Context`, or `## Debugging`. The file watcher reindexes the change on the next memory search, so the new entry is searchable within the current session.

You can also save a note directly with the `/remember` command:

```
/remember always open PR links after pushing
```

Run `/remember` with no text to enter remember mode, where the next line you type becomes the note. Either way, Grok opens a review panel showing the note (with an optional rewritten version you can toggle with `Tab`); the note is written only after you confirm. On save, Grok shows `Memory saved to ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md`.

### Forget

Ask Grok to forget something, and it finds and removes the matching entry:

```
> forget the snake_case convention
```

Forget is best-effort: the model searches memory and removes entries that match. For guaranteed removal, edit the files under `~/.grok/memory/` directly and delete the entry yourself. To locate a file, open the `/memory` browser and press `y` to copy its path.

### Recall

Ask what Grok remembers:

```
> what do you remember?
```

Grok searches across all memory files and summarizes what it knows, grouped by source: global preferences, project-specific knowledge, and session history. Use `/memory` to browse the raw files.

### Direct Editing

You can edit memory files directly under `~/.grok/memory/`. The file watcher reindexes your changes on the next memory search. Use `/flush` to save the current session now, and `/dream` to consolidate session logs into organized topics.

---

## Browsing Memory with /memory

The `/memory` command opens a modal showing all memory files:

```
/memory
```

Files are grouped by scope:
- **Global** -- cross-project memory (`MEMORY.md`).
- **Workspace** -- project-specific memory (`MEMORY.md`).
- **Sessions** -- per-session summaries, in reverse chronological order.

The modal uses a split-pane layout: the file list on the left, a read-only content preview on the right. The preview updates as you move through the list.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` | Move through the file list |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn` | Jump 10 entries |
| `/` | Filter the file list |
| `y` | Copy the selected file's path to the clipboard |
| `x` | Delete the selected session file (press `x` again to confirm) |
| `t` | Toggle memory on or off |
| `Ctrl+F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Esc` | Close the modal, or exit filter mode |

The preview pane is read-only. Scroll it with the mouse wheel or by dragging its scrollbar. You can delete only session files, not the global or workspace `MEMORY.md`.

When the memory modal's content area is under 80 columns, the modal hides the preview pane and shows the file list only.

You can also open `/memory` from the command palette.

---

## Memory Notifications

When you save a note with `/remember`, Grok confirms in the scrollback:

```
Memory saved to ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
```

Background saves — flush, dream, and session-end — run silently and do not post a scrollback message. Use `/memory` at any time to browse what Grok has stored.

---

## Dream Consolidation with /dream

The `/dream` command consolidates scattered memory fragments into organized topics:

```
/dream
```

Dream reorganizes individual session logs and memory entries into a coherent, deduplicated knowledge base, which reduces noise and improves search quality over time. `/dream` requires memory to be enabled.

### Auto-Dream

Dream also runs automatically. By default, Grok checks the consolidation gates when a session ends and runs Dream once enough time has passed and enough sessions have accumulated:

```toml
[memory.dream]
enabled = true     # Run automatic consolidation (default: true)
min_hours = 4      # Minimum hours between consolidations
min_sessions = 3   # Minimum sessions since the last consolidation
# check_interval_secs is unset by default, so Dream runs only at session end.
# Set it to a positive number of seconds to also check on a periodic interval.
```

---

## How Memory Affects Prompts

### First-Turn Injection

On the first turn of each session, Grok automatically searches memory for content relevant to the current project and injects it as context. This means Grok starts with knowledge from previous sessions without a reminder.

First-turn injection can be configured:

```toml
[memory.initial_injection]
enabled = true     # Enable or disable first-turn injection
min_score = 0.0    # Optional score threshold; unset by default, which applies no filtering
```

### After Compaction

Memory is also searched after auto-compaction to recover relevant context that may have been discarded.

---

## Memory Search

Grok searches memory automatically, but you can also trigger searches manually in the chat:

```
Search memory for "auth middleware patterns"
Read my workspace MEMORY.md
```

The model has access to two memory tools:
- `memory_search` -- Hybrid search across all memory (vector + full-text)
- `memory_get` -- Read a specific memory file by path

### Hybrid Scoring

Memory search uses a weighted combination of:
- **Vector similarity** (semantic) -- weight: 0.7
- **BM25 text similarity** (keyword) -- weight: 0.3

Results are filtered by a minimum score threshold (default: 0.35).

### Source Weights

Each memory source has a weight multiplier applied to its score. All sources default to `1.0`, and you can adjust any of them under `[memory.search.source_weights]`:

| Source | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `workspace` | 1.0 | Project-specific memory |
| `session` | 1.0 | Session logs |
| `global` | 1.0 | Cross-project memory |

### Temporal Decay

Session memories decay over time so recent sessions are prioritized:

```toml
[memory.search.temporal_decay]
enabled = true           # Enable time-based decay
half_life_days = 7.0     # Score halves after this many days
```

Only session chunks decay. Global and workspace memories are exempt since they contain curated long-term knowledge.

### MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)

MMR re-ranking penalizes redundant results to improve diversity:

```toml
[memory.search.mmr]
enabled = false          # Opt-in diversity re-ranking
lambda = 0.7             # 0.0 = max diversity, 1.0 = pure relevance
```

---

## CLI Commands

The `grok memory` command manages memory from the shell. It has one subcommand, `clear`:

```bash
# Clear workspace memory (MEMORY.md, sessions/, and index.sqlite). This is the default scope.
grok memory clear

# The same scope, stated explicitly
grok memory clear --workspace

# Clear the global MEMORY.md
grok memory clear --global

# Clear both workspace and global memory
grok memory clear --all

# Skip the confirmation prompt (-y is the short form)
grok memory clear --yes
```

To edit memory from the shell, open the files in your editor directly -- for example, `$EDITOR ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md`.

| `semantic_dedup_threshold` | unset | Cosine-similarity threshold for de-duplicating flushed content. When unset, defaults to `0.92`. |

### Pruning Settings (`[compaction.pruning]`)

You configure pruning under `[compaction]`, not `[memory]`, because it is a compaction behavior. Remote settings can override these defaults.

| `hard_clear_age_turns` | `10` | Turn age after which tool results are replaced with a placeholder |

---

## Memory Staleness

When a session memory is old, Grok attaches a staleness note to it in search results. Older results get a stronger reminder to verify the current state before you rely on them. These notes help you spot stored facts that might no longer be accurate. Global and workspace memories never receive staleness notes, because they hold curated long-term knowledge.

---

## File Watcher

By default, Grok watches `~/.grok/memory/` for external file changes. If you edit memory files directly (e.g., in your editor), the changes are picked up automatically on the next memory search:

- Created or modified files are reindexed.
- Deleted files have their stale chunks removed from the index.

```toml
[memory.watcher]
enabled = true    # default
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Not Working

1. Verify memory is enabled: check `grok inspect` output.
2. Check the flag: `grok --experimental-memory` or `GROK_MEMORY=1`.
3. Check for `--no-memory` or `GROK_MEMORY=0` overriding your config.

### Memory Not Appearing in Sessions

Memory is injected on the first turn. If you started a session before enabling memory, start a new session with `/new`.

### Viewing Memory Files

Use `/memory` in the TUI to browse all memory files with a preview. You can also access them directly:

```bash
ls ~/.grok/memory/
cat ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
$EDITOR ~/.grok/memory/MEMORY.md
```

### Debug Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug GROK_LOG_FILE=/tmp/grok.log grok
grep "memory" /tmp/grok.log
```
