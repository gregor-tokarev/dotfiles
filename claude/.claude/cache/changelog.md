# Changelog

## 2.1.269

- Added `claude plugin eval`: run a plugin's eval suite against Claude Code and get scored, reproducible results (JSON + HTML report); see `claude plugin eval --help`
- Added `/output-style [name]` to list and switch output styles, including over Remote Control and in cloud and other headless sessions
- Added a diff of the files a Bash command changed to the Bash tool result when the Bash tool handles file edits (setting `bashEditDiffEnabled`)
- Added `OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_REPOSITORY` to tag OpenTelemetry metrics and events with `vcs.*` repository attributes; commit events get `vcs.ref.head.*` with `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS`
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT_MS` to extend the LLM gateway `/v1/models` discovery timeout (default 3s)
- Added a spinner tip suggesting `/focus` for a view with just your prompt, a one-line work summary, and the response
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW_MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS` (1–256) to raise the Workflow tool's per-run concurrent agent limit for inference-bound fan-outs
- Fixed the prompt cache being partially invalidated on the turn after a response was cut off at the output-token limit and automatically resumed
- Fixed a case where resuming a session after interrupting Claude mid-thought could change how earlier context was re-sent, hurting prompt-cache reuse
- Fixed F1/F2/F4 not working in kitty-protocol terminals and Delete in st, Alt+arrows acting as Escape in rxvt-unicode, and Shift+punctuation typing the unshifted key in WezTerm (regression in 2.1.247)
- Fixed remote and headless sessions reporting "waiting for your input" while background agents were still running (set `CLAUDE_CODE_BG_TASKS_REPORT_RUNNING=0` to restore the old behavior)
- Fixed the terminal's replies to capability queries (`^[[?1;2c`) appearing as stray text at startup in some terminals
- Fixed rows at the top or bottom of the transcript going blank in fullscreen after resizing the terminal
- Fixed a deny or ask permission rule starting with `!` applying beyond the settings source that wrote it; such a rule now applies only within its own source, and a bare `!` negation is ignored
- Fixed the git status Claude is told after a compaction: it is now the current status, not the one from the start of the session
- Fixed synced plugin MCP servers not connecting when a remote session resumes
- Fixed resumed headless sessions losing a turn's replies when the model was switched or a request was retried mid-turn
- Fixed terminal escape codes, line breaks and oversized text from a background task's on-disk record reaching the task list and task notifications when work is resumed
- Fixed CMYK JPEG images failing to attach with "cannot decode"; they are now converted and resized like other JPEGs
- Fixed the managed settings approval dialog not naming the collector for a gRPC telemetry endpoint set without a scheme
- Fixed plugin `headersHelper` consent prompts showing a URL path that could be misread as a different host
- Fixed plugin errors showing `[redacted URL]` in place of a relative Windows path with a folder name that starts with `@`
- Fixed missing cursor in the permission-rule, auto-mode-rule, add-directory, session-rename and feedback-review text fields when the terminal's native cursor is enabled
- Fixed repeated clicks on a `/fork` receipt, each under a second apart, never backgrounding the session right away while it waited for the current tool to finish
- Fixed plugin LSP servers that reject `shutdown` params (e.g. rust-analyzer) being left running at session end; `exit` is now sent even if `shutdown` fails
- Fixed the attribution reminder overriding a CLAUDE.md or memory rule against commit and pull request attribution; lines set by managed settings still apply
- Fixed prompt suggestions being dropped for text in Japanese, Chinese, Thai and other languages written without spaces between words
- Fixed synchronized output being assumed from the terminal's name in GNOME Terminal and Konsole versions that do not support it
- Fixed `permission_denials` in `--output-format stream-json` results omitting Read, Edit and Write calls blocked by a path-scoped deny rule
- Fixed sessions run through the SDK or the desktop app showing an unknown status in other sessions' agent list
- Fixed `/insights` failing on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, and gateway deployments whose account can't reach the default Opus model by using the session model there instead
- Fixed organization policy limits not loading for the session when another Claude Code process refreshed the login at the same moment
- Fixed Claude Desktop sessions using Bedrock, Vertex, or a gateway not getting the contextual "what Claude needs" turn-end notification text
- Fixed MCP servers reconnecting when an updated config only changed the order of the server URL's query parameters
- Fixed the prompt box's top border splitting into extra lines when viewing a background agent whose name or description has line breaks or is wider than the terminal
- Fixed sessions getting permanently stuck on "Prompt is too long" when auto-compaction had no complete earlier exchange to summarize (mostly Agent SDK sessions with very large prompts)
- Fixed `/goal` runs silently stalling after API errors, network drops, or token limits: the goal now retries with backoff, or pauses and says why, including until a usage limit resets
- Fixed prompt cache misses in cloud sessions by waiting briefly for server configuration before the first request
- Fixed `/btw` answers that contained made-up tool calls and output: the side question is now told not to write them, and any that appear are flagged as not executed
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN` re-running a turn that had failed with an API error over 6 hours earlier, or longer ago than `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN_MAX_AGE_MS` when set
- Fixed organization plugins enabled through managed settings not loading in headless sessions and on Claude Desktop (once Desktop bundles this CLI version); they load from the next session
- Fixed plugin archives extracted for a session being readable by other local users, extracted files keeping world-writable bits from the archive, and stale files surviving re-extraction
- Fixed `Edit()` deny rules and the write-path check not applying to the file a Bash `tee` command writes; a `Bash(tee:*)` allow rule no longer covers destinations outside the working directories
- Fixed stray characters like `22c`, or a terminal's color or version reply, being typed into the prompt at startup over slow connections (ssh, browser terminals)
- Fixed the terminal's block cursor showing under the interface in rxvt-unicode after leaving or re-entering fullscreen
- Fixed the cursor block staying visible after returning from an external editor in fullscreen mode on rxvt-unicode
- Fixed the interface being drawn twice after returning from an external editor (Ctrl+G) outside fullscreen mode
- Fixed the interface being drawn twice in Konsole after returning from an external editor
- Windows: Fixed PowerShell tool commands sent to the background stopping when Claude Code exits
- Improved the `/diff` panel to open fully rendered in one step instead of showing a loading state first
- Improved prompt suggestion filtering for Japanese, Chinese and Korean text: mixed-script and single-word suggestions are kept, and meta or evaluative text is dropped as it is for English
- Improved the Skill tool's "Unknown skill" error to name the plugin skill's full name when a bare name matches exactly one plugin skill
- Improved keyboard support over SSH and in unrecognized terminals: terminals that answer the kitty keyboard query (such as foot and Alacritty 0.16+) now get Shift+Enter and Ctrl+Shift shortcuts
- Improved responsiveness in long sessions: transcript updates no longer re-process the whole conversation to build the collapsed tool-use summaries
- Improved first-party sessions with telemetry disabled: an `alwaysLoad` MCP server that finishes connecting mid-conversation is usable on the next turn without a tool-search round trip
- Changed `/ultrareview --post` to post the PR comment directly when the findings arrive and print the comment link, instead of starting a second cloud session to post it
- Changed artifact database reads that save into the session scratchpad so they no longer stop for working-folder approval
- Changed skills synced from claude.ai in cloud sessions to be named `anthropic-skills:<name>`, matching Claude Desktop; the bare name still works when nothing else uses it
- [VSCode] Added an agent map: an "N agents" footer pill opens a map of the session's sub-agents with per-agent cards, Stop agent, and read-only transcripts
- [VSCode] Added a Hooks dialog to the command menu for viewing hooks and adding, editing, or removing them in user, project, and local settings; managed, plugin, and session hooks stay read-only
- [VSCode] Added live progress rows for running subagents under the tool-call groups in Focus view
- [VSCode] Added a Permission rules dialog that lists permission rules and adds or removes them in user, project, and local settings; startup-option, session-only, and managed rules stay read-only
- [VSCode] Added a Cancel button to the Switch account screen that returns to your session as the current account
- [VSCode] Fixed Focus view showing a turn started by a delivered plain-text prompt, such as a scheduled task's, as part of the previous turn
- [VSCode] Fixed the footer's prompt cache clock hiding its minutes when the panel is narrow
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list keeping sessions from the default folder when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set in a settings file or the `environmentVariables` setting
- [VSCode] Fixed a plan preview that finished loading late sometimes hiding its comment box or showing an older plan
- [VSCode] Fixed a plan preview accepting comments that went nowhere after its Claude tab closed
- [VSCode] Fixed the prompt cache clock and reopen notice for a session compacted after its last reply and then closed, which now reads as cold when reopened
- [VSCode] Fixed a session renamed in the extension while Remote Control is on keeping its old name on claude.ai/code
- [VSCode] Fixed the "Enable Remote Control for all sessions" toggle keeping its last position after the setting was reset to default from a terminal
- [VSCode] Fixed restored Claude tabs not counting as open in the session list after a window reload until clicked, and their row opening a second tab
- [VSCode] Fixed Switch account making a tab forget its dismissed usage-limit warnings when you sign back in as the same account
- [VSCode] Fixed a session rename being replaced by the generated name after a window reload when the session was renamed during a long turn
- [VSCode] Fixed the sidebar usage meter keeping a stale per-model weekly limit row after the account loses that limit
- [VSCode] Fixed a rare case where an @-mention sent with the keyboard shortcut while a new chat view was still starting could be inserted into the input long after the keystroke
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list jumping down when the Account & usage header appeared a moment after opening the Claude side bar
- [VSCode] Improved documents and messages written for someone other than the user: Claude now writes them for that audience and names it at the top of its reply
- [VSCode] Improved screen reader and keyboard accessibility in the slash-command menu, @-mention menu, output-style picker, Send/Stop button, permission and question cards, and onboarding checklist
- [VSCode] Changed the current-file chip in the message box: an X now removes it, replacing the Hide toggle
- [VSCode] Removed the Claude Code items from a session tab's right-click menu and the editor title bar's "..." menu; they could not act on the tab the menu was opened on
- [Claude Code on the web] Added taking back a queued message in a cloud session before Claude reads it: remove it from the queue, or press Esc or Up, and the text returns to the message box
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed `/model default` in a cloud session leaving every later message failing in organizations that restrict which models Claude Code can use
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed one-off scheduled routines occasionally running a second time after a transient server error
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed routine runs that use subagents sometimes being treated as finished too early, which could skip the retry after a real failure or start a duplicate run
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed file links in cloud session transcripts opening a GitHub 404 when Claude was working from a subfolder of the repository
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed the Cloud environments admin page to list every environment instead of capping each table at five rows behind a Show more control that could be unreachable
- [Claude Code on the web] Changed claude.ai/code for Free-plan users to open the plans page with a path to upgrade, instead of a "Disabled by org admin" page with no way forward
- [Claude Tag] Added a confirmation dialog before Connect all or Disconnect on a GitHub installation in admin settings, to guard against accidental organization-wide changes
- [Claude Tag] Fixed threads occasionally going silent after a failed turn because the failure notice was dropped when Slack briefly rate-limited it; the notice is now retried
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude accepting a switch to a model your organization hasn't enabled and then quietly answering with a fallback model; it now declines and says an admin can enable it
- [Claude Tag] Fixed a table posting as raw pipe text when Claude attached files to the same message; the table now posts as a normal reply and the files follow with a plain caption
- [Claude Tag] Fixed `@Claude !restart` at the top level of a channel where Claude isn't active starting an unrelated conversation; it now privately says there is nothing to restart
- [Claude Tag] Fixed plugin rows in Slack access settings showing an unlabeled raw ID with no way to turn the plugin off; they now show its name and link to the bundle that manages it
- [Claude Tag] Fixed the shared-session banner and Share dialog on sessions started from Slack claiming the whole organization could open the link; they now name the Slack channel's audience
- [Claude Tag] Improved load time of the admin settings page and its Slack channel picker, most noticeably for organizations with many channels or several connected workspaces
- [Claude Tag] Improved scheduled routines in Slack channels: a routine run can now reply in an existing thread instead of always posting a new top-level channel message
- [Claude Tag] Improved the timestamp on Claude's live progress checklists to show each reader's local time and how long ago it was updated, instead of a fixed UTC time

## 2.1.268

- Added to the Claude apps gateway: with `pricing:` set in `gateway.yaml`, signed-in Claude Code clients receive the same rates through managed settings, so `/cost` and telemetry match the spend meter
- Added a startup warning for gateways when `access_control.allow_cidrs` is empty, and a one-time warning the first time a request arrives from a public address
- Added the `gatewayInternalNetworks` managed setting, letting administrators allow `/login` to a Claude apps gateway on their organization's own public IPv4 block
- Added `claude self-hosted-runner --remove-session-state` (default off): delete each session's per-session directories under `<base-dir>/_sessions/` when the session ends
- Added `configDirectory` to the output of `claude auth status --json`
- Added `--json` to `claude plugin install`, `uninstall`, `update`, `enable` and `disable`, and `errorDetails`/`noteDetails` to each row of `claude plugin list --json`
- Added browser-tab icons for published artifacts, chosen by Claude to match each page
- Fixed every turn failing with HTTP 400 on third-party Anthropic-compatible endpoints (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) since 2.1.265: a regex in the Artifact tool's input schema that those endpoints reject
- Fixed WebFetch hanging indefinitely on a server that keeps the response open without finishing; a fetch now fails after 300 seconds. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_WEBFETCH_DEADLINE_MS` to override the deadline (0 turns it off)
- Fixed a respawned in-process teammate picking up tools or a system prompt from a same-named agent file in a folder you have not trusted
- Fixed sustained high CPU usage: a busy loop in long-running idle sessions no longer pins a CPU core, and rapid terminal focus reports during a session recap no longer keep the CPU high
- Fixed Claude sometimes replying "your message came through empty" after an MCP tool call
- Fixed deny and ask permission rules on symlinked directories (`/etc`, `/tmp`, `/var` on macOS; `/bin` on Linux) not applying when a path was given by its real location, and Bash commands ignoring deny rules written on a symlinked path spelling
- Fixed a case where a Read or Edit deny rule did not apply when an `env -C`, `eval` or similar command the permission checker cannot analyze was on the same line
- Fixed plugin and marketplace errors showing a token or password from a git source URL
- Fixed `/mcp` and `/plugin` server details, `claude mcp list`/`get`, and MCP login errors showing secrets resolved from `${VAR}` placeholders in MCP configs
- Fixed prompt caching and extended thinking breaking mid-session for SDK sessions using `excludeDynamicSections`: the first message is no longer re-rendered each request
- Fixed entitled users being told a model is restricted after restart or in the Desktop Code tab when a cached model-access denial was stale
- Fixed a running session silently switching to the organization's default model when another Claude Code process refreshed a stale model-access entry
- Fixed long-context 429s on Fable models showing the usage-credits consent prompt instead of the 1M-context message on Pro and Team plans
- Fixed workload identity federation via a profile (as claude-code-action configures it): processes sharing the profile could fail mid-run with `401 … jti reused`
- Fixed MCP server OAuth sign-in failing with "No available ports for OAuth redirect" when the local callback port range can't be bound
- Fixed the conversation summary produced by `/compact` and auto-compact mangling text that contained `$` sequences
- Fixed resuming a conversation that ended with `/compact`: its restored-file notes now load in the same order on every resume
- Fixed SDK prompt suggestions, side questions and `/rename` sending the conversation from before a compaction
- Fixed `@` file and `/` command suggestions not appearing after recalling a previous prompt with the up arrow and editing it
- Fixed `claude agents`: pressing ← again at a natural pace to go back to the agent list no longer gets ignored until you pause for over a second
- Fixed `claude agents` session delete getting stuck when a worktree can't be removed: the message names the cause and next step, and for a git worktree ctrl+x again deletes the directory anyway
- Fixed background agent and workflow rows in the agents panel expanding to many lines when their text contained line breaks
- Fixed Claude in Slack sessions losing their Slack tools when org managed settings set an MCP allowlist
- Fixed Claude in Chrome asking to allow the host "https" when a navigation URL had a scheme but a host that could not be parsed
- Fixed the spinner wrapping onto several lines when the current task's label is long; the label and the "Next:" task line now stay within one terminal row
- Fixed the `/bug` and `/feedback` description field showing no cursor when the terminal's native cursor is enabled
- Fixed Remote Control sessions served by `claude remote-control` showing a generated name instead of their session title in `ListAgents`
- Fixed `claude plugin validate` rejecting plugin paths whose directory name begins with two dots, which the plugin loader accepts
- Fixed plugins silently skipping a default monitors file or root SKILL.md that could not be checked
- Fixed WebFetch's error for localhost and other dotless hostnames to explain why the URL is refused and suggest curl
- Fixed PermissionRequest hooks not firing in `--print` mode
- Fixed policy-helper warnings not printing on headless (`-p`) runs
- Fixed `/resume` listing a `/fork` background session under its parent's name instead of its own `⑂` fork name
- Fixed `/remote-control` and other claude.ai-gated commands to suggest `/login` when signed out instead of showing a Claude for Enterprise migration message
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSIONEND_HOOKS_TIMEOUT_MS` not extending SessionEnd hooks that have no per-hook `timeout` (they were still cancelled after 1.5 seconds)
- Fixed `/autofix-pr` and other cloud-session commands saying to retry or install the Claude GitHub App when no GitHub account is connected; they now point to `/web-setup` or the web connect page
- Fixed cloud-session commands such as `/teleport` and `/remote-env` to explain when an organization policy turns them off, instead of answering "Unknown command"
- Fixed Bash sandbox instructions over-stating confinement: no unenforced path lists when filesystem isolation is off, and strict mode no longer claims commands can never run unsandboxed
- Improved fullscreen mode: adding or removing a prompt line (Shift+Enter) now repaints as fast as typing a character instead of re-rendering the visible transcript
- Improved `--continue` / `--resume`: the conversation appears immediately instead of waiting for SessionStart hooks, and the first message no longer re-reads the whole transcript
- Improved responsiveness during tool-heavy turns by no longer redrawing the transcript for a hidden per-tool-batch reminder
- Improved startup time in projects with `.claude/workflows/` scripts: listing them no longer parses each script
- Improved auto mode denials: the message Claude receives now names the rule that blocked the action and asks Claude to try a safer method and finish unrelated work before stopping to ask you
- Improved Claude in Chrome: long page reads now stay inline instead of being saved to a file and read back
- Improved the MEMORY.md truncation warning to say how many lines were cut and where the cut starts
- Improved the terminal permission prompt for artifacts: it now leads with the ask's question
- Improved the prompt footer: an editor or `/diff` selection now shows inside the prompt input, and fullscreen mode shows Remote Control status in the header instead of the footer
- Improved the "Usage credits required for 1M context" message to say that usage credits turned on mid-session take effect after restarting Claude Code
- Improved `/plugin`: installing, enabling or disabling a plugin now takes effect when you close the menu; `/reload-plugins` is no longer needed afterwards
- Changed the system prompt on Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry to deliver environment, model and settings details as attachments, matching first-party sessions
- Changed Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry sessions to keep the tool list byte-stable across a conversation (late-connecting tools load deferred instead of rewriting it), matching first-party sessions
- Changed the task-tracking tools (TaskCreate/Get/Update/List, TodoWrite) to be offered only on Claude 3.x, Opus 4.0–4.7, Sonnet 4.0–4.6, Haiku 4.5; set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` elsewhere
- Changed the artifact data-edit permission prompt in the terminal to a card that shows the document count and who can open the artifact
- Changed local Cowork sessions set to skip all approvals: the Artifact tool now refuses a local file outside the session's folders, or behind a symlink, instead of reading it without asking
- Changed plain `WebFetch` deny and ask rules to no longer apply to Artifact tool reads and updates; use an `Artifact` rule (or `WebFetch(domain:claude.ai)`) to block or gate them
- Changed the "N MCP servers need authentication" startup notice to announce each server once instead of at every launch
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list, settings toggles, and chat tabs when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set in a settings file or the `environmentVariables` setting
- [VSCode] Fixed the model pill, model picker and command menu going blank in open tabs for a few seconds after a login, logout or account switch
- [VSCode] Fixed Auto disappearing from the mode picker in new-tab or just-reloaded conversations when a project or local setting overrides the model named in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- [VSCode] Fixed session names reverting to the last prompt after a window reload when a SessionStart hook is configured
- [VSCode] Fixed the footer's model pill and Remote Control pill waiting for the new tab's Claude process to start when another tab in the window is already up
- [VSCode] Fixed a second Claude process running through its full startup when a session tab's launch arrived more than half a second after its config read
- [VSCode] Fixed resuming a session from the session list ignoring `claudeCode.preferredLocation: "sidebar"` (it always opened a panel), and programmatic opens resetting that setting to "panel"
- [VSCode] Fixed Windows issues: the WSL install prompt no longer appears on machines without WSL installed, and IDE diagnostics are now returned correctly for Windows files when WSL is installed
- [VSCode] Fixed the custom style builder saving a User level style in a folder the CLI does not read when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set through settings
- [VSCode] Added Left and Right arrow keys to change where an always-allow permission rule is saved, for keyboard and screen reader users
- [VSCode] Added a "Claude Code: Focus last message" command that moves keyboard focus to the newest message in the conversation, for keyboard and screen reader users
- [VSCode] Changed the Manage plugins dialog to apply installs, enables, disables and uninstalls to open sessions without a restart
- [VSCode] Changed some artifact permission prompts to omit the "don't ask again" choice, matching the terminal
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed cloud sessions running longer than about six hours silently losing files saved to persisted session folders; saves now persist for up to a day
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed "Invalid effort level" errors when a routine resumes a session, or a session starts with no set effort, in orgs where an admin caps a model's effort
- [Claude Code on the web] Improved routine creation from a conversation: when the new routine has no connectors, Claude now says so and how to add them instead of only confirming it
- [Claude Tag] Fixed the admin settings page hanging on a loading skeleton or going blank after a transient load failure; a section that fails to load now shows a Retry button
- [Claude Tag] Added a link from a Slack channel's configure page back to the organization's Claude in Slack admin settings
- [Claude Tag] Fixed a Slack Enterprise Grid channel losing its Claude settings (repository, environment, access) after a Slack admin moved it to another workspace
- [Claude Tag] Improved how Claude explains a blocked action: it now says whether a permission check, its own decision to confirm first, or missing access stopped it
- [Claude Tag] Improved reply speed: Claude now runs several read-only lookups (searching Slack, reading a thread, finding people) at once instead of one after another
- [Claude Tag] Improved formatting of comparisons: sentence-length comparisons now come as lists instead of wide tables that scroll sideways, and long table cells wrap
- [Claude Tag] Fixed `@Claude !restart` in a thread with its own session sometimes also posting a contradictory "this thread is handled by the channel session" notice
- [Claude Tag] Improved the message shown when your Claude account is in a different organization than the Slack workspace: it now explains how to connect the workspace to your org
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Markdown links whose URL is wrapped in angle brackets showing as literal bracket text in Slack instead of a clickable link
- [Claude Tag] Fixed a workspace guest's top-level @mention in a channel where guests may use Claude sometimes getting a "your Slack account isn't connected" reply instead of an answer
- [Claude Tag] Fixed a channel's long-running session being replaced with a fresh one mid-conversation; the scheduled refresh now waits until the channel and its threads are quiet
- [Claude Tag] Fixed channel-settings cards clicked more than once telling the proposing session the change was refused after it had already applied; the outcome is now sent once
- [Claude Tag] Changed memory in public channels: each channel now keeps its own notes, and Claude no longer recalls notes it saved in other public channels; workspace notes stay shared
- [Code Review] Added a note under the still-open findings list in follow-up reviews: resolving a finding's thread, not just replying to it, stops later reviews from counting it as open
- [Code Review] Fixed reviews sometimes ending as incomplete when one of the agents verifying a finding failed midway; the review now replaces that agent and reaches a verdict
- [Code Review] Fixed a push-triggered review that was queued behind a running review still posting after the pull request had been converted to draft
- [Code Review] Fixed reviews ignoring a directory's CLAUDE.md conventions when the PR edited a root file (e.g. README.md) that only shares a name with a file that CLAUDE.md lists

## 2.1.267

- Added `maxEffortLevel` setting (top-level or per model under `modelSettings`): caps the effort level on every provider, including Bedrock, Vertex and Foundry; users can still pick a lower level
- Added `--system-prompt-snapshot off` to render the system prompt fresh on every request instead of reusing the conversation's recorded prompt (for iterating on prompt text)
- Fixed Cowork scheduled tasks in the cloud failing at startup for organizations whose managed settings require sandboxing
- Fixed `/context` and other local command output rendering blank on mobile clients
- Fixed shift+enter and option+backspace not working after reconnecting to a tmux or ssh session inside an agent view
- Fixed the dim last-prompt header not appearing at the top of the conversation when scrolling up in fullscreen mode
- Fixed Workflow `agent()` calls with large output schemas being refused in auto mode instead of being checked by the safety classifier
- Fixed a case where a marketplace entry path containing a backslash could bypass the containment check for fetched marketplaces on macOS and Linux
- Fixed expired AWS or Google Cloud credentials under a host app such as Claude Desktop retrying ten times with a generic "request failed" before the re-authenticate error appeared
- Fixed resuming a session after `/compact` or another slash command ran via `-p --resume`: a spurious "Continue from where you left off." turn is no longer inserted
- Fixed resuming a large session (transcript over 5 MB): parallel tool calls and their hook output are no longer dropped from the reloaded conversation
- Fixed managed `allowedHttpHookUrls`, `httpHookAllowedEnvVars` and `allowedChannelPlugins` to admit nothing, not everything, when unreadable
- Fixed `/login` on machines whose managed settings require Claude apps gateway sign-in: Esc now closes the dialog instead of doing nothing
- Fixed artifact publishes cut off by a dropped connection mid-upload: they now retry once when Claude Code can tell the upload never completed, instead of reporting an unknown outcome
- Fixed `effort:` frontmatter on custom commands, skills, and subagents being ignored on models whose default effort is still pinned (Opus 4.7, Opus 4.8, Fable 5)
- Fixed artifact publish failing with an unhelpful error when the page file isn't valid UTF-8 or contains a replacement character (U+FFFD); the error now names the line and column to fix
- Fixed `claude agents` `@` directory menu not listing repositories created after the session started
- Fixed Remote Control clients that join a Claude Desktop or VS Code session showing a stale permission mode until it was changed again
- Fixed `claude remote-control` exiting and dropping every attached session when its server credential expires (about 30 days after start); the host now re-registers and keeps going
- Fixed the usage-limit warning flickering on and off during a session when requests for different models or modes report different limit windows
- Fixed earlier reasoning being dropped when an MCP server re-sends, or a built-in tool re-renders, a tool the model already loaded
- Fixed a tool that disappears mid-conversation, from a disconnected MCP server or an upgrade, rewriting the tool list and discarding earlier thinking
- Fixed a background worker forked from a conversation adding EnterWorktree to the conversation's tool block mid-session, which broke prompt-cache reuse
- Fixed mid-session MCP and plugin tools being added to the tool list in sessions without ToolSearch, which broke prompt-cache reuse; supported models now receive them as deferred definitions
- Fixed switching models with /model re-sending every tool definition (a prompt-cache miss); commit and PR attribution text now arrives as a conversation note that updates on model changes
- Fixed resumed sessions rewriting the inline tool set when an MCP connector reconnects at a different moment than before
- Fixed resumed sessions re-rendering tool descriptions instead of replaying the recorded ones when the first turn ran a tool
- Fixed prompt-cache misses and dropped extended thinking when a claude.ai connector's tools change between a session and its resume
- Fixed resumed sessions rewriting earlier MCP tool announcements (and dropping extended thinking) before their connectors reconnect
- Fixed a prompt-cache break when a print-mode (`-p`) conversation is resumed interactively: the system prompt prefix no longer changes
- Improved the `/diff` panel: it no longer flashes "0 files changed" and a spinner before settling, and its empty state is centered in the panel
- Improved the Bash tool's description guidance so Claude describes what a command does in plain words instead of echoing the command
- Improved sandbox guidance so Claude suggests `/copy` when clipboard commands such as `pbcopy` fail inside the sandbox
- Improved `--resume` first-render time for sessions with many Bash tool calls
- Improved prompt input responsiveness: keystrokes no longer occasionally wait a frame behind spinner or streaming repaints
- Improved prompt-cache stability: subagents and sessions started with `--system-prompt` or `--append-system-prompt` now record the system prompt and tool definitions once instead of re-rendering them
- Improved Artifact tool publish errors: when a publish is refused, the message now says why and what to do about it
- Self-hosted runner: Changed `--use-anthropic-git-proxy` to be reported to the server at registration and to print a warning for each session that still clones through the legacy git proxy
- Gateway: Changed `forward_user_identity` upstreams to return a 429 as-is to a developer whose email was forwarded, instead of failing over to the next upstream, so the proxy's per-user limits hold
- [VSCode] Fixed the extension host hanging at 100% CPU when forking, editing an earlier message, or rewinding in a conversation whose saved transcript contains a cyclic parent link
- [VSCode] Fixed pasting a screenshot on WSL2/WSLg inserting raw image bytes into the chat input; the image is now attached when the clipboard provides it, otherwise the paste is ignored
- [VSCode] Fixed chat diff blocks always rendering with a dark editor theme; they now follow the active VS Code color theme, including high contrast
- [VSCode] Fixed mixed right-to-left and English text rendering in the wrong order while typing in the message input
- [VSCode] Fixed accepting an edit in the diff view on a file with Windows (CRLF) line endings failing with "String not found in file"
- [VSCode] Fixed @-mentions dropping files whose paths contain spaces
- [VSCode] Fixed the sessions list view failing to load in windows connected over Remote-SSH when the workspace folder exists only on the remote host
- [VSCode] Fixed runaway ripgrep processes when viewing files in large or symlink-heavy workspaces
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed GitHub Enterprise Server sessions showing your GitHub account as disconnected once its token expired; PR and issue operations now refresh it automatically
- [Claude Code on the web] Fixed `gh` and GitHub API calls failing in organizations without the Claude GitHub App; they now use your connected GitHub account and say so when none is connected
- [Claude Tag] Added a "Use a custom connector" link to the preset connection forms in Claude Tag admin settings, so you can switch to a custom connection without starting over
- [Claude Tag] Fixed Claude replying "The API rejected the request as invalid" when the organization has run out of usage credits; the reply now says so and explains how to add more
- [Claude Tag] Fixed thread requests to edit or delete a message Claude posted at the channel's top level being answered with a correction instead of reaching the session that posted it
- [Claude Tag] Fixed **Connect** on Tool access requests under Admin settings > Review requests failing with "Authorization failed" or showing the requested access bundle as deleted

## 2.1.266

- Fixed a 2.1.265 regression affecting LLM-gateway and proxy setups: the undocumented `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_GATEWAY` environment variable, previously ignored unless `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` were both set, began forcing Cloud-gateway sign-in on its own in 2.1.265, so configurations that set it alongside an API key, `apiKeyHelper`, or custom auth headers failed every request with "Not signed in to the Cloud gateway". The variable on its own is ignored again; no configuration change is needed

## 2.1.265

- Added `user.email` and `user.groups` to the telemetry Claude Desktop and Cowork send through a Claude apps gateway, matching terminal sessions
- Added support for pointing `--plugin-dir` at a folder of plugins: each child folder with a manifest loads, and children added or removed while running are picked up
- Added a 1 GB cap on tool results saved to disk; the in-conversation preview says when a saved file was truncated
- Fixed resuming a foreground-spawned subagent changing its tool list and system prompt prefix, which broke prompt-cache reuse for that agent
- Fixed agent teammates and resumed subagents moving SubagentStart hook context and preloaded skills out of the prompt prefix on later turns, which broke prompt-cache reuse
- Fixed resume after the previous process died while a tool was running: the last prompt is no longer rewritten, and the interrupted tool call is kept and marked interrupted
- Fixed `/model opusplan[1m]` being rejected with "Model not found"
- Fixed syntax-highlighted code in permission prompts and messages sometimes omitting a character after a Ruby `?`, Erlang `$`, or Perl `$` sigil
- Fixed the fullscreen transcript jumping by one row whenever the slash-command or @-file suggestion list opened or closed
- Fixed a plugin path containing a backslash bypassing the symlink containment check on macOS and Linux
- Fixed plugin directories whose names begin with two dots being wrongly refused as outside the plugin root
- Fixed VS Code and SDK sessions occasionally requiring re-login when a session was closed while refreshing its token
- Fixed Remote Control sessions sending the end-of-turn signal before the reply's last message, which could show a reply as finished in the Claude app before its last part arrived
- Fixed background (`--bg`) sessions occasionally being retired mid-turn when a message arrived just before the idle timeout
- Fixed Claude Code's own git status and diff probes running clean filters configured by a nested repository inside the working tree
- Fixed the advisor tool and its instructions being re-decided per request from the request's model; the decision is now made once and announced in the conversation when it changes
- Fixed artifact publish accepting connector tool names the connector doesn't expose; the publish is now refused when none of the declared tools exist, and warned when only some don't
- Fixed `/add-dir <subdirectory>` refusing to load a subdirectory's agents when managed settings lock only skills to plugins, and promising agents when only agents are locked
- Fixed two-key keyboard shortcuts cancelling silently when the second key arrived more than a second later, as happens inside tmux; they now wait 3 seconds and show a notice when they time out
- Fixed forked skills (`context: fork`) not streaming their kickoff prompt and, with `--forward-subagent-text`, their text turns as progress events in stream-json
- Fixed a plugin's default component folder that the OS cannot check, such as a symlink loop, being silently skipped; it is now reported in `/plugin` with the error code
- Fixed the Claude apps gateway's OTLP telemetry relay pausing all forwarding to a collector for 30 seconds after it rejected a few payloads as malformed or too large
- Fixed `/plugin` Discover/Browse and `claude plugin list --json --available` showing no description or display name for marketplace plugins whose metadata lives only in their `plugin.json`
- Fixed `/login` showing "no gateway URL is configured" when re-run in a session that signed in to a Claude apps gateway set by managed settings
- Fixed `/model` claiming a model was "saved as your default" when the settings file couldn't be written; it now says the save failed and why
- Fixed `/clear` from Remote Control waiting on SessionStart hooks and on open terminal dialogs before completing
- Fixed the `/config` dialog changing height when switching between its tabs
- Fixed resuming a workflow run after its container restarted; a resume whose run journal is missing now fails with a clear error instead of rerunning every agent
- Fixed the `claude-api` skill's error-code reference: model access failures return 404 and unavailable beta headers return 400, not 403
- Fixed non-interactive sessions (`-p` with stream-json input, Agent SDK, cloud sessions) resetting the shell working directory at each new user message; a `cd` now persists across turns
- Fixed MCP servers configured as `http` that only speak the legacy HTTP+SSE transport never connecting; Claude Code now falls back to SSE as the MCP spec describes
- Fixed some claude.ai connectors in cloud sessions showing as needing authentication even though they are connected in claude.ai (servers that answer an unsupported request with HTTP 401)
- Fixed remote sessions keeping their sandbox container alive while a connector approval or sign-in link waits for you
- Fixed resumed sessions showing long model-facing recovery instructions in "background task didn't finish" notices instead of a short status line
- Windows: Fixed Read, Write and Edit refusing every file ("symlink resolution changed after permission was checked") when running inside an AppContainer or restricted-token sandbox
- Improved `--worktree` startup on large repositories: the new worktree is now checked out in parallel (git 2.32+)
- Improved `/workflows` agent detail: tool calls are marked running, failed or done, the subagent's task list is shown when it has one, and Enter unfolds the listed calls with their inputs and results
- Improved slash commands typed mid-prompt: matches now show in a list (Tab opens it outside fullscreen) instead of a single suggestion, and a plugin skill is now found by its bare name
- Improved remote MCP servers that need sign-in: Claude Code no longer registers an OAuth client with them until you actually authenticate
- Improved the time to resume long sessions that read many files
- Improved the error shown when an image over the size limits cannot be decoded: it now names the cause and how to fix it instead of only citing the limit
- Improved the Artifact tool's read of an artifact someone else wrote: the summary now treats the page as untrusted content and flags embedded instructions rather than relaying them
- Updated the `.claude` folder permission option to say what it actually allows: editing files in the project's `.claude` folder (or `~/.claude`) for the session
- Changed machines with `forceLoginGatewayUrl` in managed settings to be Claude apps gateway sessions from startup, like `forceLoginMethod: "gateway"`; a leftover claude.ai login or API key is not used
- Changed image processing to use the runtime's built-in image support; the CLI no longer extracts a native image module to the temp directory
- Changed plugin display metadata to prefer the marketplace entry over `plugin.json` on the Installed tab and `claude plugin details`, filling gaps from `plugin.json`
- Changed Claude apps gateway sessions to export OpenTelemetry directly to a collector the gateway's managed settings name in `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, instead of through the gateway's relay; sessions without a named collector still use the relay
- [VSCode] Added automatic archiving of sessions inactive for a set period (new "Archive inactive sessions" setting, default 14 days)
- [VSCode] Fixed the sidebar chat coming back blank after Reload Window or a restart when the conversation had been open for more than 10 minutes
- [VSCode] Fixed the timeline dot sitting below the text on the "Remote Control is active" message

## 2.1.263

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.261

- Added an "Organization policy" line to `/status` and `claude doctor` that says why your organization's policy could not be loaded, such as a proxy not passing the endpoint through
- Added `bashOutputMaxChars` and `taskOutputMaxChars` settings to raise how much command and background-task output Claude receives inline before it is saved to a file, up to 128K characters
- Added `--append-subagent-system-prompt-file` to read the subagent system prompt from a file, for prompts too large to pass on the command line
- Added `/skill-doctor` to show which loaded skills go unused and what they cost in context, so you can prune them
- Fixed typed or pasted characters occasionally landing out of order or being dropped during fast input or key repeat
- Fixed `/add-dir <subdirectory>` printing a false "couldn't be resolved" error when the working directory is on a `/net` automount
- Fixed the Bedrock setup wizard hanging when AWS or an AWS credential helper never responds (it now times out with a clear error), and its model checks failing behind a TLS-inspecting proxy
- Fixed cloud sessions discarding a plugin synced from claude.ai when managed settings force-enable it in `enabledPlugins`, then falling back to a marketplace clone that could fail
- Fixed being unable to delete the character immediately before an inline `[Image #N]` chip in the prompt input
- Fixed resuming a session losing hook output and other context around parallel tool calls, which changed the resumed request
- Fixed Remote Control showing a stale permission mode when a phone, browser, or claude.ai app attaches to a terminal session or after the mode changes in the terminal
- Fixed Remote Control sessions showing as still working (stuck spinner and Stop button) after stopping a turn from a connected phone or browser, or after a local slash command like `/clear`
- Fixed SDK and cloud sessions ignoring a Stop or interrupt sent just after the first prompt, before the turn had started; the turn now stops instead of running to completion
- Fixed Remote Control uploading a session pulled with `/teleport` into the connected session, which appeared appended to the original on phone and web
- Fixed Remote Control's inbound event stream failing behind TLS-inspecting corporate proxies on native Windows
- Fixed Remote Control sessions showing the default effort level on claude.ai when the effort comes from settings
- Fixed `gcpAuthRefresh` opening a browser at startup when the Google credential check was slow, even though the credential was still valid
- Fixed claude.ai connectors staying absent for the whole session when the startup connector fetch timed out — the CLI now retries in the background
- Fixed sustained high CPU usage when a background agent could not be resumed and its wake-up was retried in a tight loop
- Fixed feature flags gated to a newer version occasionally applying to an older Claude Code version running on the same machine
- Fixed `/usage` and the VS Code usage panel dropping a model-specific weekly limit row when the usage endpoint is rate limited or when opened right after startup
- Fixed `claude -p --resume <file>` adopting a malformed session ID recorded in the transcript; it now resumes under a fresh session ID instead
- Fixed the terminal progress indicator (iTerm2, Ghostty, ConEmu) showing the session as finished while a background workflow or agent was still running
- Fixed a rare layout glitch where a box could render with the wrong height after its container switched between row and column direction
- Fixed Claude apps gateway client IP when a trusted proxy appends a port to `X-Forwarded-For`; with an access list set, an unreadable entry now gets 403
- Fixed Claude apps gateway telling Claude Desktop to export OpenTelemetry as JSON even when the terminal CLI uses protobuf, so protobuf-only collectors rejected Desktop's data
- Fixed Desktop and web showing a session as busy while it only watches an artifact for updates
- Fixed Claude in Chrome `file_upload` failing with "paths: expected array, received undefined" in local Cowork sessions run from the Claude Desktop app
- Fixed `SendMessage` to an offline Remote Control session on another machine reading as delivered; the result now says delivery is queued until that machine reconnects
- Fixed plugin install hints from CLIs run in background Bash commands: they are now detected, and the raw `<claude-code-hint>` tag no longer leaks into the conversation
- Fixed in-process agent-team teammates re-sending their first-turn tool and skill announcements on the second turn, which changed the request prefix and missed the prompt cache
- Improved the `/model` picker and the VS Code model pill to show a model's name instead of its raw Bedrock, Vertex AI, or LLM gateway ID when Claude Code recognizes it
- Improved startup on Google Vertex AI when `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set: API client creation no longer re-runs Google Cloud project discovery or spawns extra `gcloud` processes
- Improved streaming performance: already-rendered blocks are no longer re-checked by layout on each update
- Improved the dangerous-`rm` safety prompt to also catch `rm -rf` on positional parameters and inside double-quoted `sh -c` scripts
- Improved handling when the API sends no response headers: the retry now waits up to `API_TIMEOUT_MS` (10 minutes by default) instead of another 3 minutes, and the messages say what to change
- Changed a Claude apps gateway 403 on the managed settings load (at startup or after `/login`) to say Claude Code may not be enabled for the organization, instead of advising a new sign-in
- Changed machines whose managed settings pin `forceLoginMethod: "gateway"` to ignore a leftover API key or claude.ai login and ask for `/login`; Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry sessions are unaffected
- Changed auto mode to treat a link that packs content into a public diagram renderer's URL as an upload to that site: no longer auto-approved unless you asked for it
- Changed the prompt's word-editing keys to match Bash: Ctrl+W deletes back to whitespace, Alt+F and Alt+D stop at word end, punctuation separates words; `keybindingFlavor` no longer has any effect
- Changed `/context` token counting to use a local estimate when the token-counting API is unavailable, instead of extra small-model requests
- [VSCode] Added a "Build a custom style" walkthrough to the Output styles menu that writes a custom output style file and lists it right away
- [VSCode] Added an Add server form and a Remove action to the MCP servers dialog, so MCP servers can be added and removed without leaving the IDE
- [VSCode] Added a hollow ring in the session list for sessions open in a terminal, another VS Code window, or Claude Desktop, so they no longer look closed
- [VSCode] Added a fold button to permission and question prompts so the conversation behind them can be read without dismissing them; the space beside the prompt now scrolls the conversation
- [VSCode] Added "Archive session" to the session list's right-click menu and gave Unarchive its own icon
- [VSCode] Fixed a session teleported from Claude Code on the web treating a question that was cut off when the cloud session shut down as declined
- [VSCode] Fixed the session tab's Rename box opening empty for a tab restored with the window; it now starts with the current name
- [VSCode] Fixed collapsed sections in the session list panel briefly showing expanded each time the panel loaded
- [VSCode] Fixed Focus view showing a tool call as still running after Claude had moved on, such as while a question waited for your answer
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list's active-row highlight going stale when an unfocused Claude tab's session ID is corrected
- [VSCode] Fixed Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+T reopen and deep-link opens placing the Claude tab outside the Claude editor group when a Claude tab has focus
- [VSCode] Fixed the session tab's "Add to group" putting a session opened from Claude Code on the Web in two groups; it now moves the entry the session list shows
- [VSCode] Fixed the model picker showing models an organization has since disabled until the window was reloaded twice
- [VSCode] Fixed a tab opened from the session list jumping back to that session, and a tab opened from a Web session restarting its teleport or staying empty, after VS Code reloads the tab's view
- [VSCode] Fixed `/btw` side-question history from earlier sessions being overwritten when a question is asked right after a window reload or while a settings file has errors
- [VSCode] Fixed the pending question card not reappearing after the Claude panel reloads when signed in with a Claude.ai or Console account
- [VSCode] Fixed claude.ai-only features staying visible in a window's other Claude panels after one panel picked up a third-party provider from a settings file
- [VSCode] Fixed the sign-in screen appearing despite the Disable Login Prompt setting when Claude Code reports no login or a request fails for lack of one
- [VSCode] Fixed the next queued permission prompt keeping text typed on the previous prompt and accepting an immediate second click
- [VSCode] Fixed install-plugin links opening the Claude sidebar without the install dialog in a window where only the session list had been shown
- [VSCode] Fixed the sidebar usage meter staying empty on a new window until the Account & usage dialog was opened, and a 0% usage limit being left out of the meter
- [VSCode] Fixed "Start new session in this group" losing the group after New conversation, and a missing unread dot for a session that finished before the sidebar's unread list loaded
- [VSCode] Fixed the editor tab badge showing unread during a running turn or missing on a tab opened from the session list, and "Add Session Tab to Group" doing nothing for an archived session
- [VSCode] Fixed "Enable Remote Control for all sessions" so flipping it also applies right away to sessions open in other VS Code windows
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list's Open filter for sessions continued from claude.ai whose tab was still recorded under the web session, and labeled the filter menu's sections for screen readers
- [VSCode] Changed the model picker to one flat list of every model, with rows kept for older model spellings listed last

## 2.1.260

- Added a diff panel that opens beside the conversation in fullscreen mode and shows your uncommitted changes as Claude edits; toggle it with `/diff`
- Added a likely cause for prompt-cache misses (e.g. tool definitions or system prompt changed, idle past the TTL) to `/cost` and the status line's `prompt_cache` field
- Added `/reload-plugins` to headless sessions, so it appears in the Claude Code Desktop and SDK command lists
- Added a text form of `/advisor` (`/advisor`, `/advisor <model>`, `/advisor off`) for the desktop app, Remote Control, and other headless (`-p`/Agent SDK) sessions
- Added `oidc.scope_on_refresh` to the Claude apps gateway for IdPs that return an id_token on refresh only when asked for `openid` again
- Added Claude apps gateway support for newer Claude Desktop keys in `desktop` policy blocks, including `userPluginMarketplacesEnabled` and `userPluginUploadsEnabled`
- Fixed `Edit`/`Write`/`Read` permission rules whose path contains parentheses being dropped as invalid or ignored by the Bash sandbox, which left "read-only" folders writable
- Fixed one file permission rule with an uncompilable pattern (e.g. an unclosed `[`) making every file edit fail with `Invalid regular expression`; such a deny rule now guards the literal path it spells
- Fixed Bash permission checks auto-approving zsh commands that hide a command substitution in a REPORTTIME, REPORTMEMORY or DIRSTACKSIZE assignment; these now prompt for approval
- Fixed Bedrock model discovery, token counting and AWS SSO/STS credential calls failing with "unable to get local issuer certificate" when the corporate root CA is only in the OS certificate store
- Fixed `permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories` on macOS hiding the user's git config from sandboxed git and hiding a worktree-isolated sub-agent's own checkout
- Fixed managed settings not loading for claude.ai Enterprise/Team users who also had a leftover API key from an earlier `/login`
- Fixed `/status` listing a signed-in claude.ai account and a configured API key as if both were in effect; the credential not in use is now marked
- Fixed managed `skillOverrides` entries keyed on a bundled skill's alias (e.g. `checkup` for `/doctor`) not applying, and `Skill(name)` deny rules not covering a nested skill listed as `<dir>:name`
- Fixed `model: fable` agents ignoring the `[1m]` tag on an `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` pin and silently running with a 200K context window
- Fixed the `/model` picker not showing Fable 5.1 for organizations that can use it, which was only accepted when typed as `/model claude-fable-5-1`
- Fixed prompt caching on Claude Fable 5.1 not covering the context attached after tool results, so it was re-sent as uncached input on every tool-call turn
- Fixed model switching staying blocked for the rest of the session after a plugin hook load failure; each switch now re-checks and the refusal names the cause
- Fixed model switching being blocked for the session when an organization-managed plugin's marketplace could not be loaded
- Fixed SDK-provided MCP servers (e.g. Desktop connectors) sometimes missing from the first turn and only appearing on the next one
- Fixed Claude in Chrome tools failing with "Not connected" mid-task in cloud-hosted claude.ai sessions when a connector was added or removed
- Fixed flags, joined emoji and accented letters splitting across wrapped lines, and stale text staying on screen when a flag or joined emoji falls in the terminal's last two columns (now shown as `…`)
- Fixed Remote Control accepting a model pick that is not a valid model name; it is now refused with an error instead of failing on the next message
- Fixed `/rewind` and `--rewind-files` reporting success when checkpoint backup files were missing and nothing was actually restored
- Fixed `/rewind` leaving stale file-read tracking from the rewound-away turns, which caused "File unchanged since last read" stubs and full-file re-injection after external edits
- Fixed `-p --resume`/`--continue` (as used by the desktop app) failing on every retry once a session's worktree directory lost its git metadata; it now fails once, then resumes without the worktree
- Fixed a subagent that resumed another agent via SendMessage never being woken by that agent's completion (the notification went to the main conversation instead)
- Fixed agent teams: an in-process teammate's transcript losing messages, or going blank, during long API retry waits (e.g. under `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG`) as retry notices evicted real messages
- Fixed a session that moved to the background appearing twice in ListAgents (once as a phantom "interactive" twin with the same name) and receiving SendMessage deliveries in the viewer
- Fixed intermittent "task output swap refused" errors when many sessions share a project directory
- Fixed Ctrl+Z in fullscreen leaving the shell on the alternate screen, drawn over the paused interface
- Fixed Workflow tool subagents being restarted as stalled while a long context compaction was still in progress
- Fixed plugins from a URL marketplace failing to install with "marketplace entry path does not stay inside the marketplace directory" when a host app (e.g. Claude Desktop) stores it as a directory
- Fixed an extra browser tab opening when an artifact is published in a session you're driving from claude.ai, the desktop app, or mobile (Remote Control)
- Fixed the Artifact tool's first call failing with an "Invalid tool parameters" validation error in some Cowork sessions
- Fixed IDE line selections being dropped when running a skill or slash command (the "N lines selected" context now reaches Claude)
- Fixed repository detection for GitLab projects in nested subgroups (e.g. `gitlab.com/group/subgroup/project`)
- Fixed `owner/repo#123` issue references in rendered output linking to github.com when working in a GitLab repository; they now link to the gitlab.com issue
- Glob/Grep: Fixed the search path being probed on disk before the permission check; a missing path is now reported after permission is decided, as Read does
- Reverted the 2.1.259 change applying `Read()` deny rules to Bash arguments; it denied `npm run build` under a `Read(./**/build/**)` rule in every mode and made `cd … && grep` prompt even in auto mode
- Improved structured output: Workflow `agent({schema})` rejects a JSON Schema that can never be satisfied up front, and retry-cap errors now include the last validation failure
- Improved deleting a background session whose worktree has unpushed commits: the message now names the branch and commit count, and deleting again discards the worktree
- Improved the Claude apps gateway's refresh-failure log to name the step that failed
- Improved idle CPU usage of non-interactive (`-p` / SDK) sessions
- Improved the Claude apps gateway on Amazon Bedrock: input tokens for an aborted request are now counted with AWS's free CountTokens API (grant `bedrock:CountTokens`) instead of a one-token request
- Improved the settings error for rules such as `Edit(C:\dir\(name)\**)`, where `\(` is read as an escaped parenthesis rather than a path separator, to suggest an unambiguous spelling
- Improved auto-compact for 1M-context models: Opus and Fable sessions now compact shortly before the 1M-token limit, and recovery compaction on very large contexts no longer times out at 10 minutes
- Improved `/ultrareview` and `claude ultrareview` to wait up to 45 minutes (previously 30) for long-running cloud reviews
- Improved `/effort` on Claude Fable 5.1 so changing effort mid-session no longer invalidates the prompt cache
- Updated the bundled `claude-api` skill so its Go, Java, and C# samples use current-generation model IDs, and clarified that cheaper worker or sub-agent models should be current-generation too
- Changed `ctrl+l` / `cmd+k` in fullscreen mode to clear the transcript view like a terminal `clear`; scroll up to see earlier messages
- Changed permission rules with text after the closing parenthesis (e.g. `Bash(ls) x`), which never matched anything, to be reported as invalid settings instead of being silently ignored
- Changed server-managed settings so a managed CLAUDE.md (`claudeMd`) no longer triggers the security approval dialog; hooks, shell-command, sandbox, and unsafe `env` settings still require approval
- Changed Claude in Chrome to follow your organization's Claude in Chrome admin setting; when an admin turns it off, `--chrome`, `/chrome` and the browser tools are unavailable
- Changed Claude apps gateway to send `orgPluginSettings` in the list form read by Claude Desktop 1.15200.0 and later; older desktops ignore it
- Changed Claude apps gateway to also refuse to start, naming the field, when a `desktop` policy misspells a field in a nested object of a `managedMcpServers` or `orgPluginSettings` entry
- Changed commands typed at the `!` bash-mode prompt to run outside the sandbox even when strict sandbox mode (`sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`) is on, like typing into your own terminal
- Changed self-hosted runner `--kill-session-after-min` to release a session that is only waiting on its user (paused, resumable on the next message) instead of killing it and reporting a failure
- Removed the one-hour time limit on background commands started by subagents; they now run until they exit or are stopped, matching the main session
- [VSCode] Added the selected effort level to the footer model pill, fixed a stale effort level after switching models, and returned the footer pills to their earlier compact size
- [VSCode] Added Open and Closed to the session list's status filter menu
- [VSCode] Fixed the welcome screen disappearing in a new session when Remote Control turns on automatically
- [VSCode] Fixed the session history picker loading a session a second time when it is already open in another tab; it now switches to that tab
- [VSCode] Fixed the session tab's Rename command silently doing nothing while the tab's view was reloading; it now always applies
- [VSCode] Fixed a half-finished message, an empty tool card or an extra "Thought for" line staying on screen after Claude Code retried a dropped response
- [VSCode] Fixed "Enable Remote Control for all sessions" not applying to a session tab that was still starting when the toggle was flipped

## 2.1.259

- Added `managedMcpServers` managed setting: organizations can provide HTTP/SSE MCP servers to every user (same entry shape as `.mcp.json`); entries that name a command to run are skipped
- Added `--permission-prompts none` for unattended headless hosts: anything that would prompt is denied automatically while the active permission mode (including auto mode) keeps deciding
- Added recognition of `glab mr create/merge/close/reopen/note/update` so GitLab merge requests show as `MR !N` in the collapsed tool summary and refresh the footer MR badge
- Added `--json` to `claude plugin validate` for a machine-readable validation report
- Fixed concurrent sessions silently reverting each other's `~/.claude.json` changes — workspace trust no longer resets and MCP/project state is no longer lost when running many sessions at once
- Fixed a conversation whose thinking was rejected once being rejected again on every later turn
- Fixed Bash `Read()` deny rules not covering files given as option values (`--ignore-revs-file=.env`, `-f.env`, `@file`), `git diff`/`git grep` file operands, or `cd DIR && cat FILE` compounds; `grep -r`/`cp -r` over a directory holding a denied file now asks
- Fixed the prompt cache being invalidated when the OAuth token refreshed in sessions with telemetry disabled
- Fixed fullscreen mode showing a blank conversation after a long turn with hundreds of tool calls
- Fixed auto mode running a turn on a model it doesn't support when a command or skill's frontmatter `model:` named one; the turn now keeps the session model
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` being ignored for Vertex-style model IDs (`@YYYYMMDD` suffix) of model versions Claude Code doesn't recognize
- Fixed the live output preview of a running shell command hiding its newest lines when an earlier line wrapped
- Fixed a background GitHub connection check that ran on every launch for claude.ai users; the result is now remembered across launches
- Fixed `--resume` failing (and `--continue` opening an empty conversation) when a saved session contains an attachment entry with no payload
- Fixed frontmatter `model:` on custom commands and skills being ignored in interactive sessions
- Fixed Artifact publishing failing once with an "unexpected parameter `note`" error in conversations continued from an older version
- Fixed managed `forceRemoteSettingsRefresh` being ignored at startup when a policy helper configured by MDM or the managed settings file had already run
- Fixed worktree isolation refusing hook-created worktrees on machines where `git rev-parse` fails with a message other than "not a git repository"
- Fixed OpenTelemetry metrics and events from cloud sessions missing the `user.email`, `organization.id`, and `user.account_uuid` attributes
- Fixed MCP servers that disconnect while their tools are being listed at startup showing as connected with no tools instead of reporting the error
- Fixed the file edit permission dialog sometimes showing a changed line cut short with no indication
- Fixed repository detection dropping a known repo identity after a transient git probe failure
- Fixed managed settings silently going unenforced when the managed-settings file, a drop-in, the MDM plist, or the HKLM value cannot be parsed: Claude Code now refuses to start and names the source
- Fixed Stop not actually stopping background agents and workflows in remote-control sessions: killed tasks now stay visible and re-stoppable until their processes exit
- Fixed resuming a workflow run while its previous stopped run was still exiting, which could run duplicate copies of its agents
- Fixed marketplace repo URLs on github.com with a trailing slash or dangling `?`/`#` producing an unusable `.git` clone URL
- Fixed blocking Stop hooks causing the turn after a block to lose the model's reasoning from that turn and, on some models, miss the prompt cache
- Fixed remote (claude.ai) sessions taking 60 seconds to start a turn after a browser-hosted MCP server's page had gone away
- Fixed worktree-isolated sessions refusing common Bash loops, xargs pipelines and launcher-wrapped commands that cannot reach the main checkout
- Improved terminal resize and first-render performance for long responses by reusing text measurements
- Improved `/workflows` agent detail: JSON outcomes are pretty-printed with syntax colors and real line breaks, and long outcomes fold behind an expand toggle
- Improved headless/SDK session start: the first turn begins up to 50 ms sooner when MCP servers finish connecting
- Improved `/install-github-app` to explain it is GitHub-only and point to the GitLab CI/CD docs when run inside a GitLab repository
- Improved nested background subagent results to be saved in the parent subagent's transcript, so resumed subagents keep them and shared transcripts show the delivery
- Changed `allowedMcpServers` to govern only servers users add: a literal `managed-mcp.json` server your allowlist used to filter out now loads on upgrade; use `deniedMcpServers` to keep it off
- [VSCode] Added an Active quick filter and a status filter menu (Needs input, Working, Completed) to the session list sidebar
- Fixed remote and scheduled sessions doing nothing after a connector-tool permission prompt was approved while the session was paused

## 2.1.258

- Fixed Claude Code failing to launch on macOS 12 (Monterey), a regression introduced in 2.1.255
- Fixed remote and scheduled sessions failing with "user messages must have non-empty content" after a re-sent permission approval could not be applied

## 2.1.257

- Added Claude Fable 5.1 (`claude-fable-5-1`), now the default Fable model — 1M context, $10/$50 per Mtok with $0.25/Mtok cache reads
- Added "Time format" (`timeFormat`) and `timeZone` settings: 12-hour, 24-hour, 24-hour UTC, or a strftime pattern for the turn-end clock and transcript-view timestamps
- Added a Containment Escape rule to auto mode so cloud metadata-credential fetches, egress evasion, and cross-tenant reach are no longer auto-approved unless your environment marks them expected
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE` to apply `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` (or the main model) to every subagent, ignoring per-spawn and agent-definition model overrides
- Added `s` in `/effort` to change effort for the current session only, matching `/model`
- Added a `/doctor` warning for stale sandbox mask files left by a killed session
- Added a one-time prompt in auto mode before the first file read outside the working directories, with the option to block such reads (`permissions.blockReadsOutsideWorkingDirectories`)
- Added support for a gateway-supplied `description` on discovered `/model` picker entries (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`); entries without one still read "From gateway"
- Fixed settings in a `.claude/` folder created after startup not being picked up until restart
- Fixed sessions dispatched from an agent view opened with `←` always starting in the original session's permission mode, overriding the target directory's `defaultMode` and the agent's `permissionMode`
- Fixed `keybindings.json` rebinds of Ctrl+G being ignored in `claude agents`; its Ctrl+S / Ctrl+T are now rebindable via the new `Agents` context
- Fixed background sessions failing to start on macOS npm installs during a self-update, and on Windows when a stale daemon lock file pointed at a reused process id
- Fixed the working spinner stopping while a response streams behind a slash-command panel
- Fixed a background session's `state.json` `detail` repeating its own dispatch prompt after a scheduled wake-up
- Fixed `claude agents` keeping a background session you re-prompted buried in Completed after it finished again; Completed now orders by the latest finish
- Fixed `claude --bg` from a directory that was just deleted reporting "backgrounded" and leaving a crashed session row; it now prints the reason and exits 1
- Fixed Remote Control connecting mid-session re-sending the Bash tool definition, causing a prompt-cache miss
- Fixed a doubly-listed custom `Authorization` header overriding the configured credential on Bedrock, Mantle, Vertex, and WIF, and the Vertex setup wizard picking up a leftover Anthropic profile from `~/.config/anthropic`
- Fixed Claude apps gateway sending stray host `Authorization` or profile headers to Foundry, Vertex, and Bedrock, and Foundry Entra ID upstreams not starting when `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` is set
- Fixed a leftover Anthropic API key or auth token being sent alongside your Foundry subscription key in API-key mode
- Fixed `/schedule` routines whose prompt was saved without a message role and then ran with nothing to do
- Fixed `claude agents` not saying that a background session is waiting for you to approve a message from another session, or who sent it
- Fixed a prompt stashed with Ctrl+S inside an opened background session being lost when the session went idle or was stopped and then reopened
- Fixed telemetry (OTEL) settings pushed through server-managed settings being ignored on warm starts, including desktop-app Code sessions
- Fixed a teammate permission request being answered twice when the leader's mailbox write was briefly locked
- Fixed a phantom duplicate slash-command row rendering below the in-flight turn while a command's auto-continued response streamed
- Fixed `policyHelper` `timeoutMs` and `refreshIntervalMs` values above the timer maximum (2147483647) causing failures or re-runs every millisecond; they are now clamped
- Fixed the token counter freezing or crawling after switching to another subagent's transcript, and made background subagents' and teammates' counters update live while a response streams
- Fixed sandbox network hosts written with a trailing dot (`example.com.`): a `deniedDomains` entry didn't block the host inside the sandbox, and "don't ask again" for such a host kept prompting
- Fixed dismissing the Remote Control consent prompt (Esc, or `n` at `claude remote-control`) counting as consent, so the next request connected without asking
- Fixed `/mcp` reconnect and enable still connecting a settings-file MCP server that a managed MCP allow/deny list or `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` loaded after startup should block
- Fixed `claude mcp remove` leaving a remote server's stored OAuth credentials behind when `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` locks MCP to plugin-only servers
- Fixed Remote Control (`claude remote-control`) sessions started from the Claude app ignoring the selected model and running on the machine's default instead
- Fixed `--disallowedTools` and session deny rules being dropped after the first settings reload when `allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly` is enabled
- Fixed `--resume` listing a backgrounded conversation twice and `--continue` reopening its stalled pre-background copy; `--continue` now also opens finished background sessions
- Fixed fullscreen mode not letting you click `!` shell command output to expand it
- Fixed background sessions left running an older Claude Code binary piling up across auto-updates instead of being retired
- Fixed `claude agents --json` briefly switching the terminal to raw mode and undoing another program's terminal settings on exit
- Fixed Proactive output style sessions busy-looping with filler messages and repeated log reads instead of idling while a background command or Monitor they started is still running
- Fixed subagents stopping when a response was cut off mid-stream by a computer sleep, dropped connection, or server error; they now automatically continue instead of ending with an incomplete response
- Fixed `←` doing nothing in the `/btw` panel inside a `claude agents` session: it now returns to the agents list (even mid-answer), and the panel comes back when you reopen the session
- Fixed sessions with an advisor model set missing the prompt cache on background requests (compaction, `/recap`, prompt suggestions) and re-sending the full conversation uncached each time
- Fixed `claude -p` exiting about 5 seconds after its final result while a Monitor the model armed was still running; it now waits for the watch to fire or time out
- Fixed a `permissions.ask` rule being skipped in auto mode when the matching command ran inside a compound command or subshell, letting it run without the confirmation prompt
- Fixed plugins being able to read files outside their own directory through a declared command, agent, skill, hooks or other component path that is a symlink; such paths are now refused with an error
- Fixed `/add-dir` rejecting a directory inside the current working directory; it now loads that directory's skills, commands, and agents like `--add-dir` does at startup
- Fixed the main agent not being told when you resume a subagent you had stopped from its transcript view
- Fixed a crash when pasting ANSI-colored text (e.g. a CI log) into dialogs like `/feedback`
- Fixed `claude mcp add/remove` hanging or exhausting memory when the project's `.mcp.json` is a FIFO or a device-file symlink; it now fails fast with an actionable message
- Fixed unbounded memory growth when non-JSONL data is piped into `claude -p --input-format stream-json`; it now fails fast with a clear error
- Fixed backgrounding a turn (`←` or Ctrl+B) while a subagent or other tool was running occasionally making the background session treat that tool as rejected instead of re-running it
- Fixed Bash `Read()`/`Edit()` deny rules not applying to `< file` redirects and reader commands like `tac` and `egrep`; a deny rule on any argument or redirect target now refuses the command
- Fixed resuming or messaging a subagent whose transcript had grown past 5 MB (for example after reading many images) failing with "No transcript found"
- Fixed worktree-isolated sessions refusing Bash loops, `$VAR` reads, `"$(…)"` and heredocs that never touch git as "too complex to verify that it stays inside the worktree"
- Fixed `/model` and `/effort` showing a prompt-cache warning after rewinding a conversation back to empty
- Fixed prompt-cache misses on every turn in long screenshot-heavy sessions once images exceeded the per-request size cap
- Fixed the Edit permission prompt's diff view rendering emoji and multi-code-point characters with incorrect widths
- Fixed WebSocket MCP server connection failures being logged as "[object ErrorEvent]" instead of the underlying error
- Fixed background sessions failing to open with "Couldn't start the background service" while another Claude Code process was downloading an npm update; the start now waits for it
- Fixed background commands that detach from their shell (for example under `timeout` or `setsid`) surviving a task stop or Claude Code exit
- Fixed Claude not being told when you stop a background command from the tasks panel or a connected client
- Fixed stopping a background subagent leaving its monitors running
- Fixed sandboxed git commands in a linked worktree losing write access to the repository's common `.git` directory after `cd` into a subdirectory
- Fixed Bedrock and Bedrock Mantle requests going silent during long hidden-thinking phases on Opus 4.7 and later, which let idle timeouts cut the connection; the stream now carries progress events
- Fixed launching Claude Code after a Claude apps gateway expired or revoked your session: it now says the session ended and offers `/login` instead of reporting a network error
- Fixed cloud sessions losing git/GitHub credentials for the rest of the session when the session's network proxy failed to start at launch; it now retries in the background and recovers
- Fixed leftover `cc-daemon-*` folders in the system temp directory after an interrupted background daemon start; the `cleanupPeriodDays` retention sweep now removes them
- Fixed Bash permission checks auto-approving certain `[[ ]]` conditionals that zsh parses differently from bash; these commands now prompt for approval
- Fixed the managed-settings approval prompt showing the generic warning instead of its telemetry wording when the settings also turn detailed tracing or raw API body logging off, or trace export on
- Fixed agent-team teammates in tmux/iTerm2 panes sometimes staying open after acknowledging a shutdown request
- Fixed the keyless Console sign-in ("Sign in with your Console account") not applying your organization's server-managed settings, and `/status` not showing the Organization for that sign-in
- Improved rendering performance: less re-render work per turn in long conversations, streaming no longer slows down as the reply grows, and background-agent updates no longer re-render the whole screen
- Improved prompt input responsiveness by reducing per-keystroke rendering work
- Improved policy helper diagnostics — refresh failures now show in `/status`, declining the managed-settings dialog prints why Claude Code exited, and helper timeouts are reported as timeouts
- Improved `/code-review --comment` to post findings on GitLab merge requests via `glab mr note` instead of reporting the target as unsupported
- Improved notifications: an MCP elicitation or permission ask queued under another dialog now sends its idle desktop notification at the same delay as a visible ask
- Improved verbose/transcript output: async hook completion notices that arrive together now appear on one line instead of one line per hook
- Improved `claude self-hosted-runner --configure-git` to also enable git push negotiation, so the first push of a new branch from a stale clone uploads only the new commits instead of the whole tree
- Improved liveness reporting to SDK hosts while a response is held open by gateway keep-alives, so long waits under a raised `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` are not mistaken for a hung session
- Improved MCP connection and OAuth debug/error logs so credentials carried in a server's URL or request headers are redacted
- Improved `/fork` to keep the original conversation's prompt cache in the new background session: its worktree briefing now arrives as a message instead of a system-prompt change
- Improved emoji autocomplete to accept the remaining GitHub/Slack shortcode aliases (`:satisfied:`, `:telephone:`, `:collision:`, …)
- Changed `--effort` to lift a new model's default-effort hold for that session only rather than permanently; an effort picked on claude.ai for a Remote Control session now applies during the hold
- Changed a `policyHelper` in MDM or `managed-settings.json` shadowed at launch by cached server-managed settings to run (or exit) as soon as the fetch reports them removed, not at the next launch
- Changed `managedSourcesBehavior: "merge"` to take `sandbox.credentials.awsPairs` and `sandbox.ripgrep` whole from the highest managed source that sets them instead of combining the sources' values
- Changed gateway model discovery (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1`) to run even when `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` is set, since it only queries your gateway
- Changed `claude --resume <session-id> --bg` to continue that session under its own ID when nothing is running it, instead of silently starting a copy; a copy is now announced
- Changed `/btw` history browsing from `←`/`→` to `Shift+←`/`Shift+→` (or `[`/`]`), stepping through your recent side questions and back to the live answer
- Changed `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` in `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` to be ignored, like `"auto"`; set it in user or managed settings, or pass `--permission-mode`
- Changed `fable` and `best` in Claude apps gateway sessions to keep resolving to Fable 5 for now, since gateways not yet configured for Fable 5.1 reject it; pick Fable 5.1 in `/model` to use it
- Changed `--add-dir`, `/add-dir`, and `additionalDirectories` to refuse network paths (UNC shares, `/net/<host>` automounts) with a message before touching them; on Windows use a mapped drive letter
- Changed Claude apps gateway sign-in and token refresh requests to verify the gateway's pinned TLS certificate, as the managed settings fetch already does
- Changed Cowork and claude.ai cloud sessions: reading an artifact that isn't yours now always asks you first, even in auto mode
- Removed the Ctrl+E command explanation on Bash and PowerShell permission prompts
- [VSCode] Added collapsible ACCOUNT & USAGE and SESSION MANAGER section headers to the session list panel, with the account email, the usage meter, and a View details link opening the usage dialog
- [VSCode] Added a model pill to the input footer that shows the current model and opens the model picker, with an Effort row and a "More models" page
- [VSCode] Added a collapse toggle to the Ungrouped section of the session list
- [VSCode] Added output style selection to the command menu, including custom styles
- [VSCode] Fixed third-party provider deployments (Bedrock, Vertex, and others) still showing claude.ai-only features (remote sessions, dictation, usage) and calling claude.ai with a leftover login
- [VSCode] Fixed the session list panel's usage meter staying blank after the panel loads; it now shows the last known usage immediately
- [VSCode] Fixed the "Enable Remote Control for all sessions" toggle so turning it on or off applies to sessions that are already open, not only to new ones
- [VSCode] Fixed screen reader announcements: a control character before a fence or heading no longer drops visible lines from speech, and bold markers spanning a heading are no longer mis-paired
- [VSCode] Changed the action menu to list slash commands in a filterable "Slash commands" dialog instead of inline; picking one runs it; the MCP servers dialog gained the same filter box
- [VSCode] Changed "Delete session" to "Archive session": archived sessions move to a collapsible "Archived sessions" group at the bottom of the list with an Unarchive action

## 2.1.252

- Fixed Bash commands failing with "task output swap refused (tasks dir moved or linked)" on some Macs
- Fixed "always allow" not saving in a project that has no .claude/settings.local.json yet
- Fixed Remote Control sessions hosted by Claude Desktop or VS Code stalling for minutes after a tool finished when the connection to claude.ai was degraded
- Fixed background task notifications with very large failure output (for example git errors on a full disk) making the conversation exceed the API request size limit

## 2.1.251

- Added `PreModelSwitch` and `PostModelSwitch` hook events (block, confirm, or annotate a model switch); `SessionStart` resume hooks now receive session staleness and the estimated re-cache cost
- Added live streaming of a foreground subagent's tool calls and results to Remote Control clients (background subagents, the default, still show status only)
- Added a Spend limit bar to `/usage` and a `rate_limits.spend_limit` status line field for developers behind a Claude apps gateway with spend limits
- Added a per-session prompt-cache line to `/cost` (hit ratio, misses, tokens re-cached, warm/cold) and a matching `prompt_cache` object for status line scripts
- Added `attach`, `logs`, `stop`, `respawn`, and `rm` to `claude --help`; the `--resume` message for a running background session now names the exact `claude attach <id>` command
- Fixed file tools (Read, Write, Edit) following a symlink swapped inside the working directory after the permission check, which could read or write outside the approved location
- Fixed plugin commands declared in a marketplace entry being able to point outside the plugin directory; such paths are now rejected with a path-traversal error
- Fixed project settings being able to enable detailed beta tracing or raw API body logging, and a lower-scope beta tracing endpoint bypassing an OTLP collector pinned by managed settings or a host app
- Fixed the Workflow tool reading (and quoting in errors) a `scriptPath` outside what the session may read before the permission check ran
- Fixed Grep and Glob not applying `Read(...)` deny rules to files reached through a symlinked search path
- Fixed conversations getting stuck on "text content blocks must be non-empty" errors after a turn where the model produced only thinking
- Fixed the first launch on a fresh install starting in default mode instead of auto mode for accounts whose startup default is auto mode
- Fixed Opus 5 requests failing with "effort … is not supported when thinking is disabled" when effort was xhigh/max and thinking was turned off; effort is now sent as `high` in that case
- Fixed replying to a message Claude Desktop delivered from another session: `SendMessage` to that session id now delivers through Claude Desktop instead of failing with "not reachable"
- Fixed TUI lag with many parallel subagents: per-second progress ticks now replace their predecessor instead of piling up in the transcript
- Fixed agent teams: a teammate's final answer not reaching the team lead — it now arrives in the idle notification instead of a content-free "available" notice
- Fixed background subagents being unable to reply to a message from an unnamed sibling or parent agent (`from` was the agent type, which is not an address)
- Fixed managed-settings `disableAutoMode` arriving mid-session not moving an already-running auto-mode session back to default mode
- Fixed a "switch to Opus 1M for 5x more context" tip that appeared even when the current Opus model already has a 1M context window
- Fixed Claude apps gateway sessions treating a stored Anthropic profile (e.g. a Console sign-in) as active: listing it in `/status` and retrying gateway 401s with it, though requests never use it
- Fixed cloud sessions telling Claude the model had changed when the host was only setting the session's initial model
- Fixed Remote Control reporting a failure when an organization's policy disables it; it now shows a single quiet notice instead
- Fixed `/mcp reconnect` on Remote Control showing a generic withheld-detail error instead of the real remedy when a server was disabled in another session
- Fixed `--input-format stream-json`: client-injected assistant tool calls sent without a message id were merged into the first one and their results lost, including when resuming older sessions
- Fixed session transcripts being silently overwritten when a directory change relocated a session onto an existing same-ID transcript
- Fixed background sessions and their subagents being unable to edit files inside a git worktree they created with `git worktree add`
- Fixed background sessions occasionally starting without any plugin skills (and staying that way) when another Claude Code process was refreshing the plugin marketplace at the same moment
- Fixed selecting text in an opened background session inside tmux over SSH: it now copies to the tmux buffer like a foreground session instead of falling back to OSC 52
- Fixed SDK and cloud sessions hanging indefinitely when an SDK MCP server's handshake acknowledgment was lost; the wait now times out after 70 seconds and marks only that server failed
- Fixed self-hosted runner leaving a stuck session's Bash tool processes running after the session was force-stopped
- Fixed `/usage-credits` for Team and Enterprise members whose admin set the org's usage-credit limit to $0: it now offers to ask the admin instead of saying a cap was reached
- Fixed `--worktree --tmux` with a merge-request number on a gitlab.com origin trying a doomed GitHub-style fetch first instead of fetching the GitLab ref directly
- Fixed Ctrl+G failing with "Emacs quit unexpectedly" in background sessions for editors that open `/dev/tty`, such as `emacs -nw` and `micro`
- Fixed an `additionalDirectories` entry containing a null byte crashing startup, or breaking `/add-dir` and later settings updates when it came from an SDK host, IDE, or hook; it is now skipped
- Fixed the MCP server menu's copy shortcut: it now says how the sign-in URL was copied instead of always claiming success
- Fixed italic text (such as the session recap line) rendering as highlighted blocks in GNU screen and in tmux sessions using a `screen` terminal type
- Fixed `claude mcp add --header` and `claude mcp add-json` help text naming the wrong transports
- Fixed `claude ultrareview` and `/ultrareview` waiting the full 30 minutes when the cloud session fails to start; they now stop early and report the reason
- Fixed Bash permission checks auto-approving commands that assign an arithmetic expression to an integer shell variable (e.g. `OPTIND=1/0`, `RANDOM=2+2`); these now prompt for approval
- Fixed backgrounded sessions (`←`, `/background`, `--bg`) losing a Vertex/Bedrock gateway (`ANTHROPIC_*_BASE_URL` + `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_*_AUTH`) exported in the shell, so every request failed
- Fixed `claude --bg --model fable` on Max plans stopping to ask for usage credits while the interactive session on the same account still had Fable allowance
- Fixed the one-time "make auto mode your default" offer appearing in unattended sessions (e.g. agent-team teammate panes), where a stray keypress could accept it unread
- Fixed the managed-settings approval prompt re-appearing after signing in again to the same Claude apps gateway when the settings are unchanged
- Fixed disabled `/bug` and `/share` reporting that `/feedback` was disabled; tips, `/help`, and refusal messages no longer suggest `/feedback` when an org policy or env var turns it off
- Fixed cloud session creation advising GitHub setup after a transient GitHub connection failure — the message now says to retry instead
- Improved CPU usage during turns in interactive sessions by cutting redundant UI re-renders
- Improved install size: the native binary is about 5 MB smaller
- Improved cloud sessions: when the session's network proxy drops a connection during a Bash command, the tool result now names the host and reason instead of only "connection reset"
- Improved `/schedule` to explain that MCP servers configured in Claude Code can't be attached to cloud routines, instead of a bare "No MCP connectors" message
- Improved framing of messages from your own subagents: Claude is told the sender is a worker inside this session, not an unrelated Claude session
- Improved the prompt placeholder to read "Message @name…" while viewing a background subagent or fork transcript opened from the subagent panel or `/tasks`
- Improved sanitization of MCP server names in error messages, menus, and command results
- Improved Amazon Bedrock session start under `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST` (e.g. Claude Desktop): a session given a Bedrock model ID or ARN no longer waits for inference-profile discovery
- Improved the managed settings approval dialog to list only the settings that changed since you last approved them
- Improved retry when the model's tool call is malformed: the broken output is now dropped from the retry context, including on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry
- Changed `/radio` to be available on Bedrock, Vertex AI, Foundry, and Claude Platform on AWS, and when telemetry is disabled
- Changed Claude in Chrome so browser actions always go through Claude Code's permission checks, including in sessions with telemetry disabled, which previously used the Chrome extension's own prompts
- Changed `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` to set the default subagent model rather than override everything: an agent definition's `model:` and an explicit per-spawn model now take precedence over it
- Changed the default commit trailer to `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code` when the active model isn't a recognized Claude model (e.g. third-party models behind a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`)
- Changed the default model for seat-based Enterprise subscriptions to Opus 5, matching other premium plans
- Changed `/effort` to save your default effort level per model, so each model keeps its own setting when you switch
- Changed analytics to no longer turn off before sign-in solely because managed settings force gateway login (or cannot be read); they stay off once signed in to the gateway or via `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`
- Changed the footer PR badge on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, and when telemetry is off, to call the GitHub API directly (via `gh auth token`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) instead of `gh pr view`
- Changed how Bash command output files are created and read back when commands run in the sandbox, so a sandboxed command cannot redirect or replace them
- Changed plugin/LSP install suggestions and the auto-mode default offer to wait until you've sent or cleared what you're typing, so the Enter that sends your prompt can't answer them
- Changed server-managed settings that terminate sandbox TLS, route sandbox traffic through your own proxy, inject credentials, or weaken sandbox isolation to require approval before they apply
- Changed `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` from managed or project settings to require approval when it sets a credential, org/tenant, routing, or API-behavior header (e.g. `Authorization`, `Host`)
- Changed project-level `.claude/settings.json` `env` to no longer set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR`, or `TMPDIR`/`TMP`/`TEMP`; set them in your shell, user, or managed settings instead
- Removed syntax highlighting for six rarely used languages (1c, gml, isbl, mathematica, maxima, sqf); the binary is 2.5 MB smaller
- [VSCode] Fixed the sign-in screen's "Bedrock, Foundry, or Vertex" button opening the docs at the top of the page instead of the third-party provider setup section
- [VSCode] Changed the Remote Control banner to a footer pill (shown while Remote Control is on or has failed) that opens the session on claude.ai/code; turn it on or off with `/remote-control`

## 2.1.250

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.248

- Added `--restricted` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_RESTRICTED=1`): removes the built-in tools that run commands or code and `WebFetch` (unless named in `--tools`), keeps file tools inside the working directory, refuses `bypassPermissions`, and ignores user, project and local settings files
- Added `experimental.cacheTtl` (`"5m"` or `"1h"`) to agent frontmatter: a per-agent prompt cache TTL used when no subagent TTL setting is configured
- Added `claude self-hosted-runner --client-label <label>` (or `SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_CLIENT_LABEL`) to override the label the runner registers with (default: hostname)
- Added server-managed settings diagnostics: a startup warning when the settings fail to load, and a `/doctor` and `/status` line explaining a load failure or why they weren't fetched (Bedrock/Vertex/third-party provider, custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`)
- Added a warning in `/web-setup` when the GitHub CLI token lacks the `workflow` scope, since pushes to very large repositories can be rejected without it
- Added `/usage-credits` for Enterprise organizations billed through AWS Marketplace, self-serve Enterprise, and Enterprise trials, so members can request a higher usage limit from their admin
- Added cross-session messaging (`SendMessage` / `ListAgents`) between sessions on the same machine on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, and when telemetry is disabled
- Fixed a prompt-cache miss (and lost extended-thinking context) roughly once an hour in long sessions, caused by tool definitions being re-rendered after an OAuth token refresh
- Fixed the `ScheduleWakeup` tool definition changing between a session and its `--resume` when the account had entered usage overage, causing a full prompt-cache miss on the resumed session's first turn
- Fixed Claude Desktop and Cowork sessions disappearing after 30 days: the transcript cleanup now keeps desktop-written sessions while they are in the app (unless org policy manages retention); the new `desktopSessionCleanupPeriodDays` setting caps the exemption
- Fixed being sent to the login screen when another Claude Code process held the token refresh lock while the session token had expired; the request now fails with a retryable error instead
- Windows: Fixed the `claude agents` list not responding to the keyboard after detaching from a session, or when launched in a terminal tab left in win32-input-mode
- Fixed the recommended Console sign-in in `/login` failing with an OAuth error before showing a sign-in URL on machines where it can't be used (for example when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or an API key helper is set); it now falls back to the API-key sign-in
- Fixed model names in `/model` and fast-mode switch notices to render as code, so suffixes like `[1m]` display literally instead of as a link
- Fixed `claude agents` skipping the workspace trust prompt when the `CI` environment variable is set
- Fixed `claude agents` crashing on launch when the PR-status cache held a malformed entry
- Fixed agent view resurrecting a weeks-old background session after the machine was off: such a session now shows as stopped at its real end, and opening it asks before resuming its saved conversation
- Fixed agent view sometimes opening an older conversation, and dropping the typed prompt, when starting a new session
- Fixed `claude agents`: opening a stopped session that you already resumed in another terminal no longer starts a second process on that conversation; the row now says it is open in a terminal
- Fixed `claude agents` and `claude rm` refusing to delete a session ("has commits that are not pushed anywhere") when its worktree branch was already merged into your checked-out default branch (e.g. local `main`) but not yet pushed
- Fixed background sessions waiting silently when a `PermissionRequest` or `PreToolUse` hook prints an invalid answer: the `claude agents` row now names the hook and the schema error
- Fixed hooks silently treating a stdout `{…}` object that isn't valid JSON as plain text; it's now reported as a hook error with the parse message
- Fixed `/mcp` listing a project `.mcp.json` entry that declares the claude.ai connector type under the trusted "claude.ai" heading; it now appears under its real scope
- Fixed MCP servers whose `headersHelper` supplies the `Authorization` header falling into OAuth discovery on a 401 instead of re-running the helper and retrying the call as documented
- Fixed `/login` to a Claude apps gateway hanging when the managed-settings security approval dialog was required
- Fixed gateway model discovery (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`) never running when `apiKeyHelper` is the only credential
- Fixed `claude logs` leaving mouse tracking, bracketed paste and the alternate screen switched on in the terminal it was run from
- Fixed the trust dialog's list of repo permission rules showing a garbled character when a long rule was cut off in the middle of an emoji
- Fixed the permission mode indicator staying hidden behind the "Press Ctrl-C again to exit" hint when you press shift+tab right after ctrl+c
- Fixed `/ultrareview` and locally seeded cloud sessions uploading uncommitted edits to `prod.env`-style and `*.tfvars` files, or to editor swap, temp, and backup copies of credential files (e.g. `key.pem.tmp`, `id_rsa.swo`); they now stay on your machine
- Fixed Remote Control sessions occasionally never showing a permission prompt or the latest messages on the connected device after the CLI silently reconnected
- Fixed cloud sessions occasionally failing at startup when the container's session credentials were not yet readable
- Fixed `claude remote-control` rejecting its own flags (e.g. `--spawn`, `--name`) when a global flag or a wrapper-injected option precedes the subcommand
- Fixed startup warnings (e.g. "N MCP servers need authentication") rendering one column right of the rest of the transcript
- Fixed a backgrounded worktree session losing its checkout: the background session now holds the worktree's lock while it runs, so cleanup and `git worktree remove` leave it alone
- Fixed @-mentions of other sessions not matching names typed with non-Latin characters (for example Korean entered through an IME)
- Fixed an invalid `crossSessionInbound` value being silently ignored: it now warns and holds cross-session messages (user settings) or refuses them (managed settings) until fixed
- Fixed rate-limit, usage, and fast-mode messages telling you to run `/usage-credits` when that command isn't available for your organization (e.g. hidden with `DISABLE_EXTRA_USAGE_COMMAND`)
- [VSCode] Fixed a chat tab getting stuck on "No conversation found" when its session was never saved; it now starts a new conversation instead
- Improved the Workflow tool's prompt footprint: its description is now about 1k tokens instead of 5.7k, with the script-writing reference moved into a bundled `workflow-authoring` skill
- Improved the prompt-footer PR badge to check GitHub less often while the pull request is unchanged; a push or a `gh pr` command still refreshes it right away
- Improved managed settings: client-side timeout, MCP startup-mode, and stream-watchdog env vars no longer trigger the settings-approval prompt
- Improved `/ultrareview <PR#>` to check before launch that the GitHub account connected to your Claude account can access the repository, and to explain how to fix it, instead of failing after the cloud session starts
- Improved cross-session messaging: falls back to a private per-user `/tmp` directory when the default one can't be used, and the notice and `/status` name the directory to fix
- Changed shift+enter in the agent view dispatch input to insert a newline (matching the prompt); ctrl+enter now dispatches and attaches
- Changed `/loop`: self-paced dynamic mode and the no-prompt autonomous default are now always available, including on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry
- Changed Anthropic telemetry export failures to log at debug level as `[Anthropic telemetry]` instead of `[3P telemetry] OTEL diag error`, so they are not mistaken for your OTel collector failing
- Changed cross-session messaging in Linux user namespaces: root-equivalent trust for unmapped owners is limited to canonical system directories
- Changed `SendMessage` from a subagent to another session: the result now notes that any reply is delivered to the parent session's conversation, not to the subagent

## 2.1.247

- Added the `SendFeedback` tool: when something goes wrong in a session, Claude can draft a feedback report for you to review and send from `/feedback` (turn off with the `feedbackDrafts` setting)
- Added `{id, text, cooldownSessions, priority}` entries, `tipsFile`, and `label` to `spinnerTipsOverride`, so organizations can rotate their own tips alongside the built-in ones
- Added a tip on Bash permission prompts pointing to auto mode, with a one-keystroke "Yes, and switch to auto mode" option
- Added `/claude-api cost-optimize` to profile an existing project's Claude API spend and work through cost levers (caching, token hygiene, batch, effort, model choice) one measured change at a time
- Updated the `/claude-api` skill with Admin API coverage (organization members, invites, workspaces, API keys, rate limit reports, workload identity federation, CMEK)
- Fixed fast arrow-key + Enter sequences acting on the row above the one you navigated to in history search, `/config`, `/mcp`, `/skills`, background tasks, and `/model`
- Fixed sub-agents dying on a first-call model 404: they now use the session's fallback model chain, and the error returned to the parent includes the error type, status, request id, and model
- Fixed a hook or background agent that printed megabytes of error output being able to overflow the conversation and wedge the session on "Prompt is too long"
- Fixed Ctrl keyboard shortcuts not firing under non-Latin (e.g. Cyrillic) keyboard layouts in kitty-protocol terminals
- Fixed text like `<35;150;7M` being inserted into the prompt when a mouse report arrived split across reads right after the escape prefix
- Fixed the Bash sandbox's after-command cleanup deleting a dotfile-managed `~/.claude/settings.json` symlink (nix/home-manager, stow) when it is repointed outside the sandbox's writable area
- Fixed `/terminal-setup` overwriting your entire Zed `keymap.json` instead of merging in its keybinding
- Fixed `/rename` silently confirming when the session registry could not be updated; it now says other sessions may still show the old name
- Fixed `/compact` and "Summarize from here" in sessions started with `--agent` summarizing under the default system prompt instead of the conversation's own
- Fixed a background session showing "opening…" forever in `claude agents` after its terminal host process died; the row now fails within seconds with the reason, and Enter restarts it
- Fixed unbounded memory growth when a hook's or background task's output file could not be written; the file now notes where output was lost
- Fixed `/install-github-app` over SSH: the copy shortcut now says how the sign-in URL was copied instead of always claiming success, and the URL appears immediately when no browser can open
- Fixed shell commands carried over from the foreground logging an internal error or showing a misleading `[exited with code -1]` line when they finish in background sessions
- Fixed a version-less marketplace plugin's live cache directory being deleted and recreated on a second-scope install, which could disrupt a running session using it
- Fixed Remote Control sessions started with `/remote-control` not reporting the working-tree diff to connected clients
- Fixed self-hosted runner sessions reporting `running` before Claude Code had started, which could trigger a premature "Claude is waiting for your input" notification from the Claude desktop app
- Fixed first-run setup exiting with "Unable to connect to Anthropic services" when managed settings configure Claude apps gateway sign-in and Anthropic endpoints are unreachable
- Fixed cloud sessions (Claude Code on the web, desktop and mobile apps) sometimes showing the previous permission mode when you switch modes right after sending a message
- Fixed cloud sessions going silent when the session's container restarts between turns while a background agent, shell, or monitor is still running — the resumed session now reports the lost work
- Improved plugin marketplace hardening: names containing control or invisible characters are rejected, and marketplace-supplied text in `/plugin` and `claude plugin` output is escape-safe
- Improved Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry sessions (and any with telemetry disabled): Claude is now told when a configured MCP server failed to connect, instead of concluding its tools don't exist
- Changed Sonnet 5's default auto-compact window to its full 1M context, so sessions on the 1M window now auto-compact at about 967K tokens instead of about 934K
- Changed cross-session peer messages to collapse by default to a one-line `Message from @<sender>: <first line>` preview; Ctrl+O expands the full body
- Changed terminal hyperlinks in rendered markdown: link targets that point at a network or automounter path, contain a control character, or lead with an invisible character now render as plain text
- Changed the prompt-footer PR badge to skip its GitHub re-check on terminal refocus when the last check is under a minute old
- Changed analytics to stay off from startup, not only after login, when managed settings force gateway login or a custom OAuth deployment is configured
- Changed Claude apps gateway sign-in requests to identify Claude Code (a `surface=claude_code` device-authorization parameter and a `claude-code/<version>` User-Agent)
- Changed organization sign-in enforcement to exit at start when the administrator's managed settings cannot be read, even if host-supplied or per-user Windows registry settings exist

## 2.1.246

- Added a startup warning for Bash allow rules with a wildcard before the subcommand (e.g. `Bash(git * main)`), since they also match options inserted before the subcommand
- Added an Auto mode tab to `/permissions` for viewing and editing auto mode classifier rules
- Added the turn's completion time to the end-of-turn duration line, e.g. `✻ Sautéed for 23s · done 6:05 PM`
- Fixed fullscreen mode showing a blank transcript after resizing the terminal and jumping to the bottom until the next keypress
- Fixed a severe transcript slowdown when a diff contained a very long single line (e.g. a base64 string); such lines now render truncated with a marker
- Fixed erratic fullscreen scrolling when positioned at an earlier message, including jump-to-bottom getting stuck mid-transcript
- Fixed background sessions failing to open after 45 seconds when Claude Code's starting directory had been deleted, the machine had slept, or the host is slow to start processes
- Fixed background sessions failing to open with "Couldn't start the background service … EACCES" when another Claude Code process was re-installing the npm package at that moment
- Fixed markdown rendering being disabled for a whole message when its first 500 characters contained no markdown, and for `+`/`N)` lists and setext headings
- Fixed MCP tool calls interrupted by an incoming message in headless/remote sessions being reported to the model as "completed with no output" instead of an explicit interrupted error
- Fixed MCP tool arguments being sent as JSON strings when the parameter's schema is empty (`{}`), instead of their real type
- Fixed a command interrupted mid-run showing as "Ran 1 shell command" with no sign it was cut
- Fixed pressing ← or running `/background` during a dynamic workflow restarting its finished subagents; it now asks first and says how many subagents would restart
- Fixed opening a just-started session in `claude agents` while its worker was still booting (common on Windows) stopping it with "was stopped while the respawn was in flight"
- Fixed `claude agents` listing a backgrounded named session twice; backgrounding the same conversation again now numbers the new row (e.g. `my-session (2)`)
- Fixed the background retention sweep removing git worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` that you created yourself when an old background-session record pointed at them
- Fixed auto mode tool calls being denied as "temporarily unavailable" on very large sessions by scaling the safety-check deadline with prompt size
- Fixed the plugin cache creating duplicate SHA-named directories for the same plugin
- Fixed plugin skills whose frontmatter `name` already includes the `<plugin>:` prefix showing it doubled in the slash menu (e.g. `/plugin:plugin:skill`)
- Fixed `claude plugin update` failing for an installed plugin given its bare name (only the fully-qualified name worked)
- Fixed plugin installation failing when `plugin.json` was saved with a UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM)
- Fixed `/reload-plugins` reporting 0 skills for plugins that define skills under `skills/*/SKILL.md`
- Fixed hook error messages showing a literal `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` instead of the resolved plugin path
- Fixed `/rename` replacing the theme's prompt border color (including a custom theme's `promptBorder`) with the default cyan; the border now keeps your theme's color unless you pick one with `/color`
- Fixed custom theme diff colors (`diffAdded`/`diffRemoved` and their dimmed variants) being ignored in diffs and the `/theme` preview
- Fixed a `keybindings.json` binding with an unknown action name silently deadening that key; it is now skipped so the default binding keeps working, and a warning is logged under `--debug`
- Fixed `/stats` activity heatmap showing each day's activity one cell off (Sunday's count under Monday) in timezones east of UTC
- Fixed `/fork` from an already-forked or backgrounded session starting the new session with an empty conversation
- Fixed prompts beginning with `/--` (e.g. Lean doc comments) being rejected as an unknown slash command instead of being sent to Claude
- Fixed the `@` file picker staying open after the typed text stopped matching a real path
- Fixed the status line's cost and duration resetting to zero after navigating to the agents view and back
- Fixed fullscreen mode moving keyboard focus onto the control under the pointer when you clicked the terminal window only to bring it back into focus
- Fixed path completion failing when the completion token or working directory contained a null byte
- Windows/macOS: Fixed headless sessions not cleaning up stale entries in `~/.claude/sessions` left by sessions that exited uncleanly
- Fixed the UI stopping with a render error on the first tool call when a third-party Anthropic-compatible endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) streams a `tool_use` block without an `id`
- Fixed the Write tool reporting "Out of memory" or freezing for a long time after overwriting a very large existing file, even though the file had been written
- Fixed `claude plugin install <name>` exiting silently (or hanging in a terminal) instead of reporting an error when `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` is empty or corrupted
- Fixed resumed sessions failing every turn with a 400 when the saved history contains tool blocks the Anthropic API does not accept (typically written by a third-party API proxy)
- Fixed `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` failing with "Raw mode is not supported" for some Team/Enterprise users with server-managed settings
- Fixed sessions that ended in plan mode resuming outside plan mode in the VS Code extension, and in `claude -p --continue`/`--resume` with a permission prompt tool, when no permission mode was set
- Fixed the `Notification` hook not firing while the sandbox "Network request outside of sandbox" permission prompt is waiting
- Fixed Bash permission checks to always require approval for malformed commands with a dangling `&&` or `||` operator
- Fixed `--strict-mcp-config` sessions prompting to approve `.mcp.json` servers they would never load, which left background sessions waiting at startup
- Fixed telemetry and metrics requests to Anthropic carrying the API key configured for a third-party gateway (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`); a credential is now only sent to its own host
- Fixed a visible API error on the first prompt after idle when `apiKeyHelper` returns short-lived JWTs: an expired cached token is now refreshed before sending, and 401/403 auth errors retry quietly
- Fixed memory growing with session length in the fullscreen and Ctrl+O transcript views: each rendered message row no longer retains a full copy of the transcript-wide tool lookups
- Fixed `/ultrareview` runs and cloud sessions launched at the same time from one repository (e.g. from several worktrees) sometimes starting with another launch's uncommitted changes
- Fixed the task progress count (e.g. `3/5`) shown for background cloud sessions such as `/autofix-pr` occasionally missing a task
- Fixed Remote Control sessions keeping their placeholder name in claude.ai and the Claude app until the second prompt; the auto-generated title now appears after the first prompt
- Fixed MCP tools marked `requiresUserInteraction` still offering "Yes, and don't ask again" in their permission prompt; the option wrote an allow rule the tool then ignored
- Fixed the self-hosted runner ending its live sessions or exiting when a work-poll response is malformed (e.g. an intercepting proxy's HTML page); it now retries the poll
- Improved `/cd`: the new directory's project settings, hooks, `.mcp.json` servers (behind the usual approval prompt), skills, and agents now take effect right after the move instead of on `--resume`
- Improved Bash tool latency on bash shells by replaying snapshot functions without a base64 subshell per function
- Improved subagent results: a subagent that stops at its `maxTurns` limit now returns its output marked as partial, with a hint to continue it via `SendMessage`, instead of appearing finished
- Improved non-interactive sessions (`-p`, SDK, cloud sessions) to automatically continue a response cut off mid-stream by a server error, connection loss, or stall instead of ending with an error
- Improved attribution of usage telemetry to your organization for workload identity federation sessions, events sent while `apiKeyHelper` runs at startup, and after a login token expired while idle
- Changed `/code-review` so Claude can also start it on its own on Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry, through the Claude apps gateway, and when telemetry or non-essential traffic is disabled
- `/goal`: Changed idle sessions to start at most three check-ins on long-running background work per goal; your next message allows three more
- Changed `claude install` and `claude update` to defer a pending managed-settings consent prompt to the next interactive session instead of prompting mid-command
- Changed OpenTelemetry plugin events for plugins synced from claude.ai: `plugin_id_hash` now reflects the plugin's real marketplace, and `enabled_via` is `admin-install` for admin-installed plugins
- Fixed the command sandbox's filesystem configuration not respecting `--setting-sources`

## 2.1.245

- Fixed a crash on startup on Linux distributions that ship glibc 2.44 (for example Arch Linux, CachyOS and Fedora Rawhide)

## 2.1.243

- Added a Loops breakdown to `/usage`: per-loop run count, total tokens, tokens per run, and last run, so runaway or chatty `/loop` tasks are easy to spot
- Added `modelPicker` setting: curate the `/model` picker with an ordered, labeled list of models (any id spelling, including Vertex/Bedrock ids), appended to or replacing the built-in lineup
- Added `promptCacheTtl` and `subagentPromptCacheTtl` settings so API-key and cloud-provider users can keep a 1-hour prompt cache on the main conversation while subagents stay at 5 minutes
- Added `modelPricing` managed setting so an organization's contracted per-model rates and discount multiplier are used for `/cost`, the status line, and telemetry cost figures instead of list price
- Added a keyless sign-in under `/login` → Anthropic Console: "Sign in with your Console account" (recommended) alongside creating an API key, so organizations that don't allow API keys can sign in
- Added a `Skipped sources` line to `/status` that lists managed settings sources (for example `managed-settings.json`) present but not applied because a higher-precedence managed source is active
- Added a `managed` marker in `/mcp` and `/plugins` on claude.ai connectors whose authentication is managed by your organization
- Added a tip pointing claude.ai users who haven't connected GitHub for Claude Code on the web to `/web-setup`
- Added a `/status` line showing whether GitHub is connected for Claude Code on the web (Pro/Max), pointing to `/web-setup` when it isn't
- Added the model (and effort level) each subagent ran on to `/tasks` and the agent detail dialogs
- Fixed remote MCP servers in non-interactive (`-p`) and SDK sessions never recovering after a dropped connection; they now reconnect automatically or report as failed
- Fixed MCP server sign-in started from the desktop app failing with "Invalid redirect URI" on servers that support client ID metadata documents (for example Linear)
- Fixed auto mode staying unavailable at startup when a temporary server-side disable was cached and later flag fetches failed
- Fixed auto mode tool calls being denied as "temporarily unavailable" after about a minute of waiting when the API was briefly overloaded and asked the client to retry
- Fixed the `/model` picker silently ignoring an Ultracode selection; picking Ultracode now applies it to the current session
- Fixed `/resume` only listing the 50 most recent sessions; the picker now loads more as you scroll
- Fixed cloud sessions resuming after a mid-turn restart with a pending hook or background-task notification re-sent as the prompt instead of the normal continuation message
- Fixed cross-session messaging silently turning off inside user namespaces and rootless containers after the 2.1.232 socket-directory hardening
- Fixed text that hangs outside its container (for example the sign-in URL in `/login`) losing its leading columns when another part of the screen repaints
- Fixed `spellcheck` not underlining a misspelled word typed directly after an emoji
- Fixed background subagents not waking when their last background Bash task completes
- Fixed sessions going silent for 10+ minutes when the Anthropic API never starts a response: the request now times out after ~3 minutes, retries once, then shows `API Error: No response from API`
- Fixed auth, model-availability, and other client-generated error messages rendering like model output instead of as error lines
- Fixed workload identity federation in CI: processes in one job share the exchanged token instead of re-exchanging the single-use token; a rejected exchange fails fast with the server's message
- Fixed server-managed `companyAnnouncements` not showing at startup in a session that began with signing in (for example the first launch after `/logout`)
- Fixed hook `if` conditions like `Bash(cat *)` firing on unrelated Bash commands when the command contained `$()` or backtick command substitution followed by more arguments
- Fixed plugin dependencies declared with a `marketplace` field never resolving when both plugins are loaded together via `--plugin-dir`
- Fixed `/reload-plugins` keeping the LSP tool after the last LSP plugin is disabled; it now also warns before an LSP plugin change that would re-read the conversation
- Fixed `--agents` silently ignoring invalid JSON or invalid agent definitions; it now exits with a clear error, like `--mcp-config`
- Fixed `/status` showing "Found invalid entries in: ." with no filename when `~/.claude.json` has an invalid MCP server entry
- Fixed `/clear` removing the `/rename` session name from the prompt bar even though the name was kept for the new session
- Fixed Ctrl+R history search and up-arrow history breaking when `~/.claude/history.jsonl` contains a malformed entry
- Fixed Ctrl+[ not leaving vim INSERT mode in terminals that encode modified keys (modifyOtherKeys / kitty protocol)
- Fixed the local IDE connection being routed through `HTTPS_PROXY` (and sometimes failing) when `localhost` was listed in `NO_PROXY` but not lowercase `no_proxy`; both casings are now honored
- Fixed sandbox network-violation details being dropped from the Bash tool result when the blocked command still exited 0 (for example `curl` printing the proxy's 403 page)
- Fixed the status line `rate_limits` fields and `/usage` still showing a rate-limit window's pre-reset usage percentage after the window reset while the session was idle
- Fixed `claude --teleport <session>` exiting on uncommitted changes instead of offering to stash them and continue, as the session picker already does
- Fixed `/web-setup` repeatedly asking you to log in when an older GitHub CLI (without `gh auth token`) was already authenticated
- Fixed Claude in Chrome losing its connection to Claude Code after an auto-update cleaned up the version it was set up with; the native host now launches via the stable `claude` launcher
- [VSCode] Fixed sessions started before feature flags were first fetched (for example right after install) opening in the default permission mode instead of auto mode or your configured default mode
- [VSCode] Fixed Focus view sections you expanded collapsing on their own during subagent tool activity
- Improved startup time: sandbox and MCP bring-up no longer block the first frame, bare launches skip subcommand registration, and workflow discovery, settings, and trust-store work is cheaper
- Improved native install and auto-update download size: the binary is now zstd-compressed (about 75 MB instead of 340 MB on Linux x64)
- Improved attribution of usage telemetry to your organization for sessions that authenticate with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` directly against the Anthropic API, so its data-handling settings apply
- Improved native binary size: about 2 MB smaller by storing the bundled skill and prompt text more compactly
- Improved memory usage of native builds: code is now loaded on demand instead of keeping the whole bundle resident (roughly 40–70 MB less memory per session)
- Improved peak memory usage in long-running sessions (the runtime now garbage-collects sooner as the heap grows)
- Improved `/login` over SSH: the sign-in URL appears immediately, pressing `c` reports how the URL was copied instead of always claiming success, and a hint explains how to select text in fullscreen
- Improved the error when effort `xhigh`/`max` is used with thinking turned off: it now names the level, the setting that disabled thinking, and `/effort high` as the fix
- Improved `/loop`: consecutive wake-ups where Claude has nothing to do now fold into a single line in the terminal instead of printing each one
- Changed the sandboxed Bash tool prompt to no longer list allowed network hosts, so Claude attempts requests (and you can approve new hosts) instead of assuming unlisted hosts are blocked
- Updated the `/model` picker and the bundled `claude-api` skill to show Sonnet 5's $2/$10 per Mtok pricing as its standard list price rather than a limited-time promo
- Changed computer use on macOS so clicking the desktop, Dock, or a Finder window requires granting Finder via the access dialog, like any other app
- Changed `/model`, `/fast`, and `/effort` to also run immediately instead of queueing until the turn ends on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry and when telemetry is disabled
- Fixed `claude remote-control` exiting and stranding attached Remote Control sessions when the server drops its environment mid-session; it now recovers
- Fixed Remote Control sessions served by `claude remote-control` sometimes getting stuck after it was stopped and restarted, for Team and Enterprise members without an admin or owner role
- Changed the cross-session messaging inbox socket to close connections that send no complete line within 30 seconds; scripts posting to it should connect once their data is ready
- Improved the notice when resuming a conversation whose Remote Control is held by another terminal: it now says sessions on other machines can't be seen from, or reach, this one
- [VSCode] Improved history trimming in long sessions: older tool-activity rows are dropped first so your messages and Claude's replies stay visible
- [VSCode] Improved attribution of the extension's own usage telemetry to your organization when you are signed in with a Claude account, so its data-handling settings apply

## 2.1.241

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.240

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.239

- Cost estimates (`/cost`, status line, `--max-budget-usd`) now include the 1.1× US-only-inference premium for data-residency workspaces
- Added the one-time fullscreen renderer offer on Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry and other previously excluded setups; new installs there now start in fullscreen
- Added `/claude-api upgrade` to migrate Python projects from `anthropic` 0.x to 1.x, and updated the skill's Python reference for 1.x (timeouts use `anthropic.Timeout`, not `httpx.Timeout`)
- Cloud sessions: plugins synced from claude.ai now show as `name@synced`, work with `claude plugin enable/disable <name>@synced`, and never override a same-named plugin you installed
- Alpine/musl builds: native image paste, clipboard, and audio-capture add-ons now load (musl-built binaries instead of glibc ones refused by the runtime)
- The usage-limit message shown when your monthly spend limit is already used up now also says when your session or weekly limit resets
- Fixed Bedrock streaming behind proxies that strip the response Content-Type header, which silently doubled billed API calls by re-running every turn non-streaming
- Fixed Claude Code hanging at startup behind an HTTPS proxy when using Bedrock with an SSO profile and `awsAuthRefresh` — the credential pre-check now honors `HTTPS_PROXY`
- Fixed a raw crash dump when starting Claude Code from a directory that no longer exists; it now prints a clear message
- Fixed Edit and Write calls pausing for about 5 seconds in JetBrains IDE terminals when the Claude Code plugin is connected
- Fixed a race where pressing Esc with a prompt queued could let the next turn finish early, leaving the session idle while Claude was still working and letting a later resubmit repeat actions
- Fixed WebFetch retaining expired page content in memory for the whole session instead of the intended 15 minutes
- Fixed cloud sessions (Claude Code on the web, desktop and mobile apps) resuming out of plan mode after an idle worker restart
- Fixed MCP elicitation forms taller than the terminal being clipped in fullscreen mode: the form now fits the window, with hidden fields reachable by scrolling and Accept/Decline always visible
- Fixed remote MCP servers staying failed after a transient 5xx on a mid-session reconnect in cloud sessions or via SDK `setMcpServers()`
- Fixed custom session titles disappearing from `/resume` after more than ~64 KB of conversation was written following the rename
- Fixed `claude -c`/resume picking up sessions from a different directory whose path differed only by characters like `_`, `-`, or `.`
- Fixed `/resume` and the agents view showing a session as recently changed (and reordering it) when only its file was touched or it was merely reopened
- Fixed `/resume` in all-projects mode telling you to `cd` into a deleted directory (e.g. a removed worktree); such sessions now resume in the current directory
- Fixed the `dark-ansi` theme rendering expanded tool results in fullscreen mode with text the same color as the background
- Fixed the fullscreen renderer prompt reappearing on every launch when it could never be answered; it now stops after being shown on three launches
- Fixed `.worktreeinclude` patterns starting with `**/` silently matching nothing when the target lived in a gitignored directory
- Fixed agents, skills, and commands whose `.md` file starts with a UTF-8 BOM being silently ignored
- Fixed `/insights` echoing literal `<message>` tags in its response on some models
- Fixed marketplace `metadata.pluginRoot` having no effect: bare plugin source names now resolve under it as the docs describe
- Fixed mouse movement in browser-based terminals inserting text like `"35;150;7M"` into the prompt when a mouse report arrived split across writes
- Fixed custom theme overrides for the effort/ultracode status badge colors being ignored
- Fixed OpenTelemetry trace fragmentation: tool executions deferred by a `PreToolUse` hook now resume in the original turn's trace instead of starting a new trace
- Fixed vim mode in the agent view: Escape now switches to NORMAL mode and keeps your text instead of clearing the prompt
- Fixed the `selection:copy` keybinding silently dropping a text selection that had been extended with Shift+Arrow keys
- Fixed the `/voice` startup tip still appearing after voice dictation was enabled via the `voice.enabled` setting
- Fixed shell-mode (`!`) Tab completion dropping the `./` from a `./script` path, which left a command the shell couldn't run
- Fixed fullscreen mode answering a permission prompt or pressing a button when you clicked the terminal window only to bring it back into focus
- Fixed slash-command panels (e.g. `/config`, `/model`) in fullscreen mode covering the latest messages; the conversation now stays pinned above the panel
- Fixed the `/workflows` detail dialog overflowing the terminal and losing its header off-screen when opened while Claude is still responding
- Fixed the Linux sandbox making a nonexistent `.git/config.worktree` unreadable, which broke every sandboxed git command in repos with `extensions.worktreeConfig` set
- Fixed hooks failing with "posix_spawn ENOENT" after the session's working directory was deleted; they now run from the project root or home directory instead
- Fixed `claudeMdExcludes` not excluding a symlinked `.claude/rules` file when the pattern names the rules directory or the symlink rather than its target
- Fixed runaway session-title syncing to Remote Control when two Claude Code processes shared one background job's state (2.1.232 regression); title updates are now deduplicated and rate-limited
- Fixed sessions whose title starts with `/` being unaddressable by `SendMessage` and shown as "(untitled)" in `ListAgents`
- Fixed Ctrl+W, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+K, Option+Backspace, Option+D and vim `df`/`dt` leaving a broken `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder when the cursor was inside it
- Fixed masked (password-style) inputs such as the login code field letting their text be pasted back with Ctrl+Y elsewhere or saved to prompt history when cleared with double Esc
- Fixed Ctrl+Backspace deleting one character instead of a word in search boxes
- Fixed a request rejected by an organization policy check being re-sent before the rejection was shown
- Improved the reminder shown after compaction so a skill's original arguments are not re-run as a new request
- Long file paths on tool-use rows now truncate in the middle to stay on one line
- Remote sessions keep sending keep-alives while a long `SessionStart` or `Setup` hook runs, so the container is not idle-reaped mid-hook
- `/goal`: repeat check-ins on long-running background work now back off (30 min, then 1 h, then every 2 h) instead of repeating every 30 minutes
- `/goal`: resuming a session from the `claude --resume` picker now restores its active goal
- `ListAgents` now tells a session its own name (the one peers use to message it), and `SendMessage` to your own name says so instead of "no agent named …"
- `ListAgents` and `/list-agents` now list your live teammates (previously only subagents and other sessions appeared, so a reachable teammate looked absent)
- `keybindingFlavor: "readline"` now also matches Bash for word keys: Alt+F and Ctrl/Option+→ stop at the end of the word, Alt+D deletes to it (Ctrl+Y pastes it back), and punctuation separates words
- Persistent retry mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG`) now fails immediately on organization spend-limit and out-of-credits errors instead of waiting indefinitely for a reset
- Claude in Chrome: `/clear` now closes the session's Chrome tab group, and empty groups are closed on `/resume` and when Claude Code exits
- Remote sessions: images uploaded from mobile now include their saved file path, so Claude can copy them into files it creates
- Claude Code on the web: requests from Bash and other tools to non-API anthropic.com hosts (e.g. www, docs) now go through the session's network proxy, so your environment's allowed domains apply
- Remote Control: clearer message and `claude doctor` wording when Remote Control isn't enabled for your account
- Windows: cross-session messaging is now available, so Claude Code sessions across your machines can message each other with `SendMessage` and find each other with `ListAgents`, as on macOS and Linux
- [VSCode] "View usage" in the usage-limit banner now sits inline with the warning text instead of floating mid-banner

## 2.1.238

- Added a `keybindingFlavor` setting: set it to `"readline"` to make Ctrl+W in the prompt delete back to the previous whitespace, as in Bash; the default (`"classic"`) is unchanged
- Plugin marketplaces: `headersHelper` on a url marketplace or a catalog entry runs a command that mints HTTP headers (e.g. a short-lived token) for catalog and same-origin archive fetches
- A catalog entry's `headersHelper` runs only when you install or update that plugin, after its command is shown; `claude plugin install/update` ask `[y/N]` (or pass `-y`)
- Added `claude self-hosted-runner --defer-shutdown-max-min <minutes>`: on SIGTERM, keep serving attached sessions, park what is left after that many minutes, then exit
- Added `claude self-hosted-runner --proxy-authorization-command` / `--proxy-authorization-file` for egress proxies that require a freshly issued `Proxy-Authorization` header on every connection
- Fixed unbounded memory growth in long interactive sessions: subagent tool results are now released once they leave the recent display window
- Fixed custom, project, and plugin output styles drifting back to the default voice mid-session
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=true` not keeping prompt suggestions on when your account is near, but not over, its usage limit
- Fixed worktree-isolation Bash refusals telling you to remove a redirect when the command had none
- Fixed self-hosted runners occasionally being removed by the server after a single slow or lost poll request, handing their healthy session to another runner
- Fixed MCP elicitation dialogs showing nothing for URLs longer than 4,096 characters, and permission prompts dropping the "don't ask again" option when the project path didn't fit the terminal width
- Fixed leftover `/tmp/claude-*-cwd` files when a Bash command is killed, times out, or is interrupted
- Fixed held Backspace being ignored on terminals that send Ctrl+H for Backspace when keystrokes arrive in large bursts (slow SSH/mosh links)
- Fixed text-wrapping in permission prompt diffs: lines containing wide multi-code-point characters (such as emoji) or tabs are no longer clipped
- Fixed killing a suspended (Ctrl+Z) session sometimes leaving the terminal in bracketed-paste mode with the cursor hidden
- Fixed stdio MCP servers receiving a `server/discover` request before `initialize`, forcing lazy servers to start their backend on every session open
- Fixed a proxy's refusal of a connection being reported as a generic network error instead of naming the proxy
- Fixed the `/model` and `/effort` cache-miss warning appearing when the prompt cache had already expired
- Fixed per-task Stop from the Remote Control tasks panel doing nothing on CLI-hosted sessions
- Fixed remote sessions exiting when a client delivered a user message without a valid role
- Fixed Remote Control sessions started by `claude remote-control` inheriting session-scoped environment variables from the launching shell
- Fixed a Remote Control session whose process crashed staying unavailable until `claude remote-control` was restarted; it can now be reused when you next message it
- Fixed Remote Control messages sent from the web or Desktop while Claude is mid-turn disappearing from the transcript after the turn finishes
- Fixed Remote Control model picks made on a phone or web not updating the model shown in the terminal
- Fixed Remote Control disconnecting with "login expired" when a brief network hiccup delays renewing your sign-in; it now retries and stays connected
- Fixed Remote Control reporting a failed reconnect on sign-out; signing out now ends the session with a clear message
- Fixed `ListAgents`/`SendMessage` reporting "Remote Control is not connected" in sessions run by `claude remote-control` (server mode) or Desktop/IDE hosts; they now list and reach Remote Control peers
- Fixed `ListAgents` and `SendMessage` exposing the idle worker that the agent view pre-warms for your next background session; it now appears only once a task claims it
- Cross-session messaging: sending to a session on this machine that refuses inbound messages (e.g. `crossSessionInbound: "refuse"`) now reports "refused" to the sender instead of a silent success
- Cross-session messaging: a session whose inbox drops your messages (rate limit or full queue) now tells your session, instead of the messages vanishing silently
- Improved startup: bare `claude` starts sooner on macOS
- Improved Bash tool permission checking for zsh-specific syntax in shell conditionals
- Improved Remote Control connection resilience: brief HTTP 403 refusals from a network edge, VPN, or proxy are now tolerated for up to 3 minutes, with the refusing party named when a block persists
- Improved startup responsiveness: the automatic update check now runs about 10 seconds after launch instead of competing with startup for CPU
- Updated the bundled `claude-api` skill for the Managed Agents Aug 19 release: web search/fetch domain settings and memory stores on self-hosted sandboxes
- Changed Ctrl+L and Cmd+K in fullscreen to always just repaint — the double-press `/clear` shortcut was removed, and 1-row nvim terminals no longer trigger automatic `/clear` loops
- Changed `claude mcp list` and `claude mcp get` to show disabled servers as `⊘ Disabled` instead of connecting to them for a health check
- MCP `headersHelper` in a project `.mcp.json`, and inline MCP servers in project or `--add-dir` agent files, now require that folder's trust dialog to have been accepted (also under `claude -p`)
- MCP `headersHelper` from a project `.mcp.json`, plugin, or agent file runs without inherited credential env vars; user, managed and claude.ai-scope helpers now run from the Claude config dir

## 2.1.237

- Fixed prompt caching for sessions using an LLM gateway or custom base URL
- Added a built-in "Concise" output style: Claude leads with results and skips preamble and narration, while doing the work just as thoroughly. Select it under Output style in /config.

## 2.1.236

- Added `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL` environment variable: sets the model new sessions start on, while a `/model` pick still overrides it and persists across restarts (unlike `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`)
- Added `notify_when_idle` to cross-session `SendMessage`: ask another Claude Code session on this machine to send one notice when it next goes idle — opt-in, one-shot, no polling (macOS and Linux)
- Sandbox: on macOS, wildcard read-deny rules (e.g. `**/.env`) now take precedence inside allowed read regions, cover matched directories' contents, and can't be bypassed by renaming the denied file
- Fixed clipboard copy, background housekeeping, background sessions, and local MCP logs breaking after the directory a session had switched into was removed (since 2.1.229)
- Fixed the fullscreen renderer failing permanently after a single failed start: it now falls back to the classic renderer instead of exiting on every subsequent launch
- Fixed the `/model` picker rendering taller than the terminal: it now shows only as many models as fit the window, with the rest reachable by scrolling
- Fixed `SendMessage` calls being rejected when a malformed closing tag left the message text inside the summary field
- Fixed unhandled promise rejections when a subprocess fails to start, for example `powershell.exe` on WSL with Windows interop disabled (regression in 2.1.234)
- Fixed fullscreen mode sometimes not showing a newly sent message until the next update after the terminal was resized
- Fixed a blank band that could remain above the prompt after clearing a multi-line prompt, and panes not repainting after resizing the terminal away and back, in fullscreen mode
- Fixed the managed-settings approval prompt sometimes not appearing at startup while still capturing the first keypress as approval
- Fixed terminal tab titles jumping in tmux (iTerm tmux integration): the title is now written only when its text changes instead of animating every 960ms
- Fixed an unclear error when the cloud environments list came back empty or malformed
- Fixed the Fable 5 first-time usage-credits prompt auto-selecting the fallback model after 60 seconds with no answer when using Remote Control
- Fixed spinner tips never appearing, with a repeated background error, when the cached guest-pass reward in `~/.claude.json` was malformed
- Fixed skills hot-reload in SDK/VS Code sessions raising an error on every skills change after the session's working directory was deleted (2.1.229+)
- Fixed self-hosted runner sessions released on idle, retire, or startup timeout occasionally resuming on another runner before the post-session hook had finished
- Fixed the Clawd mascot's eyes and feet rendering unevenly in iTerm2 at some font sizes
- Fixed occasional runaway session recaps: recap text (automatic and `/recap`) is now capped at 400 characters, cut at a word boundary
- Improved startup performance: the session counter is now written in the background
- Improved auto mode: `Monitor` allow rules are now set aside while auto mode is active, so Monitor commands are reviewed the same way Bash commands are
- Improved auto mode on Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry, and when telemetry is disabled: the classifier now uses the same defaults as on the Claude API, including severity-scored classification
- Improved auto mode: the git status check can no longer be fooled by a repo's `status.showUntrackedFiles=no` setting into reporting a clean tree
- Changed the `/model` picker to highlight only the newest model's name, so the highlight marks the new release rather than an arbitrary subset of the list
- `/goal`: an idle session whose goal is parked behind long-running background work now checks in automatically after 30 minutes (then 1h, 2h) instead of waiting for you to return
- `/usage` now shows the usage-credits spend row for Team and Enterprise members, and shows a capped row at 0% before anything is spent
- SIGTERM in print/SDK mode no longer records an interrupted turn or synthetic tool denials before exiting; running commands are still terminated and the process still exits with code 143
- Pressing Enter on a slash-command typo or a command unavailable in this session now reports it instead of running the closest fuzzy match; prefixes and aliases still run
- Remote Control now marks a session offline within seconds when the CLI exits or its terminal closes
- `SendMessage` now refuses further messages to a session up front once a rapid burst would exceed what that session's inbox accepts, instead of reporting them sent while they were dropped
- Aligned the session title chip on the prompt border with the footer's right edge
- Right-aligned footer items (goal indicator, session state, background agent status) and truncated notices now share a consistent right margin with the rest of the prompt area
- [VSCode] Added screen reader support for the transcript: live announcements for replies, permission requests, errors, and status changes, plus per-turn heading navigation

## 2.1.235

- Added an optional `spellcheck` setting that underlines misspelled words in the prompt input as you type, using your installed `aspell`, `hunspell`, or `ispell`
- Fixed whole-prompt-cache invalidation when a language server disconnected or reconnected mid-session
- Fixed nested markdown list items misaligning at depth 3+ and added a hanging indent to wrapped list items in the terminal UI
- Fixed prompt input highlights (slash commands, keywords, mentions) appearing shifted by one or more characters in some multi-line prompts
- Fixed Shift+Tab inside the permission prompt's comment field approving the edit and granting session-wide edit permission instead of closing the field
- Fixed the Agent tool advertising a general-purpose default in sessions where that agent is unavailable: an omitted `subagent_type` there now gets a clear error listing the available agents
- Fixed notebook cell delete/replace approval dialogs silently omitting the existing cell content when the notebook or cell could not be read; the dialog now says why
- Fixed slash commands run while Claude is responding showing HTML entities instead of the actual characters
- Fixed the prompt footer not showing the "Update installed" restart notice after a background auto-update
- Fixed the expanded task list (`ctrl+t`) always starting collapsed when resuming or relaunching into a session that still has open tasks
- Improved memory and CPU usage while cloud sessions such as `/ultrareview` or `/autofix-pr` run in the background — their event streams are no longer re-scanned and re-rendered on every update
- Improved permission dialogs: display text and "don't ask again" options now always match what a grant would cover, and "don't ask again" is withheld when contents cannot be fully displayed
- Improved the embedded `grep` in native macOS/Linux builds: pathological patterns now fail fast instead of exhausting memory, and `-m N` with `-A/-C` prints correct context
- Improved the context-limit error to say when auto-compact is off and point to `/config` to re-enable it
- Vim mode: NORMAL mode and cursor position are now preserved when toggling the detailed transcript (ctrl+o) or closing a panel
- Dialogs: arrow keys and Enter pressed in quick succession now select the option you navigated to instead of the previously highlighted one
- `SendMessage` now refuses messages too large for cross-session delivery up front instead of silently dropping them
- Remote Control: `claude rc` now applies the same enterprise-gateway availability check as interactive startup
- [VSCode] Fixed focus jumping between open Claude tabs on its own when a window with several Claude panels is restored or reloaded

## 2.1.234

- Added the optional `CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME` environment variable: hosts that give each session its own config directory can choose a short name for the per-project transcript directory
- Added the `selection:clear` keybinding action, so a key can be bound to clear an in-app text selection; also works in the agents view
- Added a GitLab merge request badge to the footer and statusline: repos with a GitLab remote and an authenticated glab CLI show MR !N with draft/pending/green states
- Claude Code now continues your session automatically when a claude.ai usage limit resets; turn it off in `/config` ("Continue automatically at usage limit")
- Claude is now told to use your account email only to identify you, and not to send it to unrelated services unless you ask
- Security: remote file reads, session restore, CLAUDE.md includes, workflow scripts and file uploads now reject Windows NT-namespace (`\??\`) paths, hardening the remaining pre-approval file accesses against the NTLM credential-leak vector
- Fixed auto mode in very long sessions repeatedly re-checking and denying sandboxed commands' network access after the conversation had been compacted
- Fixed session-scoped permission answers (including denies) being dropped when answering background subagent tool permission prompts
- Fixed a crash when an API response on the non-streaming fallback path (typically via third-party gateways) contained a thinking block missing its thinking field or a text block missing its text field
- Fixed markdown rendering becoming extremely slow for some messages containing unusual Unicode sequences
- Fixed `SendMessage` rejecting a recipient copied from `ListAgents` when the session name is at the 200-character cap or emoji-heavy
- Fixed repository detection mis-reading the host of git remotes with unusual userinfo, producing links and repo-specific behavior for the wrong host
- Fixed MCP diagnostics printing resolved secrets: scope-conflict warnings now show the configured `${VAR}` form, and connection-failure details show only the server origin
- Fixed `strictKnownMarketplaces` allowlists accepting SCP-style git marketplace sources whose host differs from the one git would actually connect to
- Fixed modal text such as the `/login` OAuth URL losing characters when copied in fullscreen
- Fixed a `---` horizontal rule in rendered markdown running into the line after it
- Fixed consecutive shell commands splitting into multiple "Ran 1 shell command" rows when todo/task updates were interleaved between them
- Fixed dialogs like `/permissions` opened while a `!` shell command was running being dismissed when the command finished
- Fixed a queued `!` shell command being sent to the model as plain text after pressing up-arrow to edit the queued input
- Fixed queued messages reappearing in the prompt history while still queued, Esc while selecting a queued message no longer interrupts the turn, and `!` mode no longer sticks after a mid-turn submit
- Fixed accepting the "Try the new fullscreen renderer?" prompt restarting the session without its permission mode (e.g. `--dangerously-skip-permissions`), tool allow/deny rules, model or effort flags
- Fixed `/tui` dropping launch `--allowed-tools`/`--disallowed-tools` rules when it restarts; it now declines to switch, with the reason, when the session has restrictions a restart can't carry over
- Fixed trust prompts omitting the repository-wide scope warning when the directory was first seen before the repository existed there
- Fixed a case where an IDE diff tab closing during a permission re-prompt could answer the new prompt with the previous input
- Fixed: files sent to the user during Remote Control sessions hosted by Claude Code Desktop or VS Code now upload, so they open on phone and web instead of showing an empty card
- Fixed: after `/login` while `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, the stale-token reminder no longer leaks into Claude's automatically resumed turn — it now appears only to you
- Fixed: permission previews now relay only to channel servers admitted by the inbound trust gate, and a server's explicit permission-capability opt-out is honored
- Fixed: credential masking on relayed permission previews can no longer hide commands, paths, or destinations from the approver; oversized private-key blocks now redact under full-strength redaction
- Fixed: provider API tokens that mask on permission previews now mask even when directly followed by shell delimiters
- Fixed Claude Desktop inter-session messages being silently dropped by the recipient session when cross-session messaging read as disabled, which left the sender's query "thinking" for many minutes
- Remote Control: signing this computer in to a different claude.ai account or organization now stops the running session within seconds and says why, instead of a misleading HTTP 404 hours later
- Remote Control sessions started from Claude Code Desktop or VS Code now keep phones and claude.ai/code updated on the session's permission mode (and claude.ai/code on the model) as they change
- Remote Control: effort picks made on a phone or on claude.ai/code now apply to terminal- and Desktop/VS Code-hosted sessions, and the session publishes its effort level to connected clients
- `SendMessage` and `ListAgents` now say when your account's session list was too long to check completely, instead of treating unseen sessions as absent
- Expired Anthropic profile credential now points you at `/login` when a claude.ai login would take precedence
- Improved the transcript: your own prompts now render markdown (highlighted code blocks, inline code, lists) the same way replies do
- Improved the "API returned an empty or malformed response" error to say what came back (content type, body kind, size, request ID) and why the original streaming request failed
- Improved auto-generated session titles to read as short, specific names (e.g. "Login button bug") rather than sentences restating your request (e.g. "Fix the login button on mobile")
- Reduced the context cost of loading the built-in `claude-api` skill from ~200k+ tokens to ~25k by loading reference docs on demand
- `/permissions` can now be opened while Claude is working — rule changes apply to the rest of the current turn
- `/add-dir <path>` can now be used while Claude is working; `/add-dir`, `/autocompact`, `/theme`, `/help`, `/config` and `/advisor` dialogs open mid-turn in the fullscreen TUI
- `/goal` now clears itself with a notice when a turn dies on an unrecoverable error (e.g. revoked auth, an exhausted credit balance, or a context overflow) instead of staying armed
- `/goal`: when background tasks keep a goal waiting for 30+ minutes, Claude now checks in on them instead of waiting indefinitely (set `CLAUDE_CODE_GOAL_CHECKIN_MINUTES=0` to opt out)
- `claude setup-token` now rejects unexpected extra arguments instead of silently ignoring them
- Changed Esc in fullscreen mode to no longer clear a mouse text selection: it interrupts or dismisses as usual and the selection stays highlighted
- Removed the redundant "Allowed by auto mode classifier" line that auto mode showed under every Agent tool call
- Removed the "Default teammate model" setting from `/config`; agent-team teammates now use the leader's model unless the spawn names one
- Dimmed the elapsed-time counter on the running tool header so it no longer competes with the bold counts
- Background task notifications delivered between turns are now sent to the model inside `<system-reminder>` tags, matching mid-turn delivery
- Mantle: skip the admin-pin availability probe at startup when a main-loop model is already picked
- Windows: startup no longer stalls on repeated rename retries when `~/.claude.json` is read-only

## 2.1.233

- Added GitLab merge request URL support to the `--worktree` flag and the `claude agents` view (where MRs display as `!N`)
- Added an opt-in `forward_user_identity` apps gateway setting on Anthropic upstreams that sends the signed-in user's identity as headers, so a proxy behind the gateway can attribute spend per user
- Added opt-in memory cgroup support for Bash tool commands on Linux (`CLAUDE_CODE_TOOL_MEMORY_LIMIT`) so a runaway build can't stall the session
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_WEBFETCH_CACHE_TTL_MS` environment variable to configure the WebFetch session URL cache TTL (default unchanged: 15 minutes)
- Fixed cloud sessions occasionally being marked as lost when the environment shut down while Claude was waiting on a permission prompt
- Fixed MCP v2 connections endlessly reopening the subscriptions/listen stream against servers that terminate long-held streams on a fixed timeout (e.g. serverless hosts)
- Fixed Notification hooks not firing for permission prompts when running under Claude Desktop or VS Code
- Fixed idle sessions on Linux sometimes keeping one CPU core at 100% when sandboxing is enabled
- Fixed bundled skill aliases like `/checkup` and `/review` reporting "Unknown command" in `-p` mode or with plugins/MCP loaded when a user or project skill shadows the bundled skill
- Fixed skill/command argument substitution to prevent argument values from being re-expanded as template markers
- Fixed Windows paths spelled with the NT `\??\` device prefix bypassing UNC path validation, closing an NTLM credential-leak vector
- Improved `claude self-hosted-runner` session start time: the session branch is now created without rewriting the working tree, and two server round trips no longer block the agent's launch
- Improved apps gateway error forwarding: 400/413 errors from Vertex, Foundry, and Claude Platform on AWS upstreams now carry the upstream's own message; fixes a bug with auto-compact on apps gateway
- Improved `claude plugin validate` to check a bare `.claude/skills` directory, reporting SKILL.md files whose frontmatter fails to parse
- Improved screen reader mode: the `/effort` selector renders as a numbered list with a typed-number prompt, and hint and dialog text is no longer clipped
- Improved print mode diagnostics: a `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` line is written to stderr when a request goes out for a model ID Claude Code doesn't recognize; map it with `modelOverrides` to silence
- Changed the GitHub app setup tip to no longer appear in repositories whose origin remote is on gitlab.com or bitbucket.org; the enterprise marketplace tip now covers non-GitHub internal git hosts
- Todo/task-tracking tools (TaskCreate/Get/Update/List, TodoWrite) are no longer available on Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5, Mythos 5, and newer models; set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` to bring them back
- Windows: fixed auto mode repeatedly stopping for manual approval on ordinary `cd <dir> && <command> > file` Bash commands (a 2.1.232 regression)
- Reverted the 2.1.232 Bash permission changes for Cygwin-style symlinks on Windows and for input redirections (`< file`); a narrower version will return in a later release

## 2.1.232

- Subagent forking is now on by default: a `subagent_type: "fork"` subagent inherits the full conversation and prompt cache, and non-teammate agent spawns in interactive sessions now run in the background by default
- Type `@` in the prompt to mention another Claude session by name; Claude then uses `SendMessage` to reach that session directly
- `SendMessage` now delivers to a bare name that exactly matches one live session, instead of asking to confirm with a ref first
- Interactive sessions on one machine now keep unique names: starting or renaming a session to a name another live session already uses gives it a `name-word-word` variant and tells you
- Added `/config` rows for "Dialog expiry" and "Messages from your other sessions" (cross-session inbound accept/hold/refuse)
- Added secret redaction for GitLab token families (`glrt-`, `gloas-`, `glptt-`, `glagent-`, `glimt-`, `glsoat-`, `glcbt-`, `glft-`, `glffct-`) and full redaction of routable `glpat-`/`gldt-` tokens; the `glab` CLI config store gets the same sandbox and credential-path protection as `gh`
- Added GitLab support to plugin marketplaces: bare `gitlab.com` repo URLs (including nested subgroups) now clone like `github.com` URLs, and clone auth-failure hints name your actual git host
- Settings: `additionalMarketplaces` and `allowedMarketplaces` are now accepted as friendlier aliases for `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `strictKnownMarketplaces`
- Enterprise policy: a url-typed `blockedMarketplaces` entry for a bare repo URL keeps blocking that URL when the CLI classifies it as a git clone
- Gateway: the `desktop:` overlay now accepts every released Desktop setting (was 11 hand-listed keys), validated at boot against Desktop's own schema; unknown or invalid keys fail boot
- Gateway: empty `managed.policies[].match.groups`/`admin.admin_groups` entries and malformed `email_domain` values (empty, or containing `@`, whitespace, or commas) now fail at boot instead of silently matching no one or granting admin access
- Fable 5 is offered as an advisor in `/advisor` again for organizations with Fable access, with usage-credits consent set up through `/model fable`
- Fixed a PowerShell permission bypass where variable-writing parameters could silently overwrite `$PSDefaultParameterValues` and redirect later commands' file access
- Fixed a Windows permission bypass where Git Bash followed Cygwin-style symlinks that path validation saw as regular files; writes through them now require permission approval
- Fixed nested git repositories inheriting trust from a parent directory; each repository now requires its own trust confirmation
- Fixed MCP connections hanging for the full 30-second connect timeout when a server fails to answer or sends a malformed reply to the protocol-version probe
- Fixed Remote Control sessions hosted by a bridge inside a cloud session inheriting that session's transcript or credentials
- Fixed Remote Control sessions started from Claude Desktop or an IDE appearing as a new claude.ai session each time the local session was resumed; they now reattach to the existing one
- Fixed Remote Control sessions appearing unreachable to newly attached clients while idle
- Fixed Remote Control bridge sessions not restoring conversation history when the session worker restarts
- Remote Control: resuming a conversation whose session was deleted from claude.ai or the app now starts a replacement instead of failing with a message about your login (regressed in v2.1.227)
- Fixed Cloud gateway `/login` exiting silently or leaving an unresponsive terminal after "Press Enter to continue" when managed settings failed to load; the reason is now shown
- Fixed voice mode on native builds getting stuck on "listening…" when the voice service rejected the connection; the rejection is now shown immediately
- Fixed mTLS client certificate rotation requiring a restart; Claude Code now reloads the rotated cert and key automatically on connection errors
- Fixed malformed AWS or Vertex region values being used to build request URLs; they now fall back to the default region
- Fixed stream idle timeout errors failing the request instead of recovering on Bedrock, Vertex, and gateway deployments
- Fixed content-sized overlays containing truncated text rendering one column too wide, and start-truncated text collapsing to an ellipsis
- Fixed a stray garbled character where a long shell-command or agent-description preview was cut off mid-emoji
- Fixed a startup race that could silently unregister a plugin marketplace due to concurrent writes to `known_marketplaces.json`
- Fixed `/update` and `/tui` refusing to restart while work that survives the relaunch was running
- Fixed usage-limit guidance suggesting unavailable slash commands in SDK and remote sessions
- Fixed the consent message for interactive `--advisor fable` launches, which told you to run `/model fable` in an interactive session that had just exited
- Improved fullscreen streaming: long sessions stay responsive because the whole conversation is no longer re-normalized on every update
- Improved the managed settings approval dialog: shows endpoint URLs, uses clearer wording for telemetry-only changes, skips routine OpenTelemetry options, and requires approval for server-managed sandbox binary overrides (`sandbox.bwrapPath`, `sandbox.socatPath`, `sandbox.ripgrep`)
- `/feedback` and `/bug` now open immediately when invoked while Claude is responding, instead of waiting for the turn to finish
- `/plugin install plugin@marketplace` now refreshes the marketplace first, so newly published plugins install without a manual marketplace update
- `/code-review` at high, xhigh, and max effort now runs in a background agent like the other levels
- Pasted and clipboard images are read without blocking the event loop
- Remote Control now keeps reconnecting for about 30 minutes after a network blip and no longer drops after a few blips spread across an hour
- Remote Control: resuming a conversation no longer silently takes Remote Control away from another Claude Code on the same machine that still has it; run `/remote-control` there to move it
- Updated agent panel: completed subagents hide immediately with a `/tasks` footer hint, and the "↓ N more" overflow indicator moved left for visibility
- Remote Control: the terminal now says whether a session was taken over by another device, ended from another app, or deleted, and stops suggesting a reconnect that would undo it
- Bash input redirections (`< file`) are now permission-checked like their argument spellings on all platforms
- Shortened the message shown when resuming a completed background agent
- Cowork sessions no longer inline external @-imports from user-scope memory files
- Hardened the auto-generated cross-session messaging socket directory on shared `/tmp`: a pre-planted symlink or another user's directory is now refused instead of used
- Hardened the Linux filesystem sandbox against a protected-path bypass
- Changed `sandbox.ripgrep` to be honored only from user, managed, and `--settings` settings; project settings can no longer override the sandbox's ripgrep binary
- Removed the startup tip suggesting you create custom subagents, and the matching nudge in the `/powerup` tour

## 2.1.231

- Fixed MCP OAuth sign-in failing with a redirect URI mismatch for servers that use a pre-registered OAuth client, such as Slack

## 2.1.229

- Documented `claude remote-control --continue` for resuming the most recent Remote Control session
- Added server-supplied Claude Code hook support for self-hosted runner sessions, matching managed-environment behavior
- Added SSE keepalive pings to gateway streaming responses during long thinking pauses, preventing idle-timeout disconnects on Vertex and Bedrock upstreams
- Added plugin marketplace `command` sources: a local command (e.g. an IDE) prints the plugin directory, which is re-resolved each session and applied without a restart; `mode: "link"` uses it in place
- `ListAgents` now marks disconnected Remote Control sessions as `offline` and labels your cloud sessions as `cloud`
- Fixed long responses partly disappearing while streaming and being printed twice in the terminal
- Fixed a crash to the error screen (including on `--resume` of the affected session) when a tool call had a non-string `glob`, `file_path`, or `command` value
- Fixed a RangeError crash when a progress bar or markdown table rendered in a very narrow terminal window (could also crash `claude --continue`/`--resume` at startup)
- Fixed a crash on Windows when a tool call or message referenced a file by an extended-length (`\\?\`) or UNC path
- Fixed auto mode failing on every tool call for users who disable the attribution header via `CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER` (direct Anthropic API connections)
- Fixed `/model` rejecting Sonnet/Opus 1M for claude.ai subscribers using a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateway
- Fixed MCP OAuth with strict authorization servers by using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in the redirect URI
- Fixed Remote Control clients showing a stuck working spinner after a slash command typed in the laptop terminal
- Fixed the Claude Code Review workflow generated by `/install-github-app` completing without posting its review on the pull request
- Fixed multi-second UI stalls after editing a file with thousands of IDE diagnostics while the IDE extension is connected
- Fixed one-shot `claude plugin` commands leaving a stray liveness file that could prevent cleanup of outdated plugin versions
- Fixed dynamic workflows inside CPU-limited containers using the host machine's core count instead of the container's CPU limit
- Fixed a file-watcher handle leak after atomic file replacements, and an uncaught error on Windows when the scheduled-tasks watcher failed on a network or virtual filesystem
- Fixed SDK and `--input-format stream-json` sessions getting a 400 API error when a whitespace-only message was submitted
- Fixed conversations whose messages alone exceed the API's 32 MB request limit retrying compaction when no images or documents can be stripped; they now fail once with a clear message
- Fixed OpenTelemetry export from Claude Desktop sessions being rejected by the Desktop-managed gateway when that gateway is also the telemetry endpoint
- Fixed self-hosted runner and other remote sessions exiting at startup when `managed-mcp.json` is deployed and the server delivers MCP servers; those servers are now skipped with a warning
- Fixed self-hosted runner repository preparation hanging on a Git Credential Manager prompt; git now fails fast when credentials are missing
- Improved workflow fan-outs to stagger same-prefix sibling agents so subsequent agents read the cached prompt prefix instead of re-paying it (`CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOW_PREFIX_STAGGER_MS=0` disables)
- Improved "prompt is too long" errors to explain why automatic compaction could not recover instead of only suggesting `/compact`
- Improved sandbox: IPv6 literals in network domain lists are now bracketed (`[::1]:443`), and ambiguous spellings are enforced fail-closed and flagged by `/doctor`
- Updated `/login` to repeat the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` override warning after a successful login
- Changed `/commit-push-pr` so git/gh commands with dangerous flags (`--force`, `--amend`, `--no-verify`, etc.) are no longer auto-approved
- Changed self-hosted runner Windows startup to require an explicit `--base-dir`; there is no default checkout directory on Windows
- [VSCode] "Report a problem" and `/bug` now open the built-in feedback dialog instead of a retired survey link
- [VSCode] Made the `/btw` side-question panel resizable by dragging its boundary, in both side-docked and stacked layouts
- [VSCode] Added session groups in the sidebar — right-click to create, rename, or delete; Cmd/Ctrl- or Shift-click to move several sessions at once

## 2.1.228

- Fixed interactive sessions that could stop redrawing entirely, while the process kept running, after a rare internal layout error
- Fixed `git` / Git Bash not being found on Windows when Claude Code is launched from a parent folder of the git installation
- Fixed `/tui` reverting the session to an earlier model when `/model` had been changed since the last response
- Fixed cross-session messaging sometimes starting without an inbox in the first session after install or upgrade
- Fixed Remote Control `/resume` while connected leaking the resumed conversation's title or history into the connected session
- Fixed `claude self-hosted-runner` sessions failing on every fresh runner when the `checkout` hook fails for a repository the session doesn't push to; that repository is now skipped with a warning
- Fixed self-hosted runners ending sessions in the gap between a background task finishing and the follow-up turn starting
- Fixed session cleanup deleting contents inside a project's memory folder
- Fixed background plugin-cache cleanup deleting a plugin's cache when its only version is a symlinked development checkout
- Fixed a settings-merge issue where a marketplace entry redefined in a higher-precedence settings tier could inherit another tier's custom headers; marketplace entries now merge as whole entries
- Fixed the deferred-tools reminder occasionally being sent to the model twice after a skill invocation
- Hardened skills synced from claude.ai: they no longer shadow local commands or MCP prompts, their descriptions are sanitized and labeled, and on your machine their bodies don't run `!` commands or expand `@` files
- Improved cross-session messages: the sender and body now display inline instead of a collapsed line, and messages to Remote Control sessions on other machines show your Remote Control session name as the sender
- Improved Vertex AI credential handling: expired or missing Google Cloud credentials now fail within seconds instead of retrying for minutes
- Improved compaction progress: the retry countdown and stall hint now appear during compaction instead of only a progress bar
- Updated terminal title busy-spinner glyphs to reduce tab-bar jitter on some terminals
- Changed the Write tool so newer models can overwrite an existing file they haven't read this session, matching the Edit tool's rules; older models still require the read first
- Removed the outdated note about auto mode sessions costing slightly more from the first-use notice for Pro, Max, and Team plans

## 2.1.227

- Fixed feature flags being evaluated without the user's subscription tier when a session started with an expired login token, which could wrongly prompt Max plan users to enable usage credits for Fable
- Fixed every Bash command failing under `claude-code-action` with `allowed_non_write_users` on GitHub-hosted runners
- Fixed `/tui` bringing back a conversation that had been rewound to before its first message
- Improved slash-command menu: blue now marks only the selected row, matched characters are bolded instead of recolored, and emoji or accented names keep their glyphs
- Improved performance: fewer event-loop stalls on file-not-found suggestions and at-mention size checks

## 2.1.226

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.225

- Added gateway spend-limit support to Claude Code's usage warning; the limit-reached message now names the cap, its reset time, and the operator's message (requires the gateway on 2.1.225)
- Added a workspace trust prompt to `claude agents` for untrusted directories, matching the behavior of `claude`
- Fixed a transient 401 replacing a long-lived `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with a stored login's short-lived token, breaking headless sessions until restart
- Fixed MCP OAuth servers on macOS intermittently failing with a burst of 401 errors, as if never authenticated, after a keychain read timed out
- Fixed auto mode counting a safety-filter refusal of its own permission check toward the consecutive-block limit; the action is still denied, but the model is now told to move on rather than retry
- Fixed cross-session messages staying parked without a notice or expiry in headless sessions and during startup
- Fixed conversation history breaking on Remote Control session resume after very large conversations were compacted
- Fixed hovering over a session in another project in the agents list changing the directory the next agent starts in
- Fixed `claude self-hosted-runner` registering and then failing every session when `--base-dir` cannot be created or written; it now exits at startup with a clear error
- Fixed Claude Code on the web sessions being misreported as stuck, re-sending a growing event backlog on every reconnect
- Improved Remote Control: photos attached from the Claude app are now shown to Claude directly instead of being read from disk with a separate tool call
- [VSCode] Fixed Focus view folding away the latest to-do list, a pending question's context, and settled answers; thinking-only folds show "Thought for Ns" and re-collapse when their turn completes
- SendMessage can now start a conversation with your Remote Control sessions on other machines by name (`ListAgents` shows them as `name [ref]`), instead of only replying after they message you first
- SendMessage: a Remote Control recipient you already confirmed is never swapped for a same-named session on this machine when its own list couldn't be checked

## 2.1.224

- Added self-hosted environments: `claude self-hosted-runner` turns your own machines or containers into a place Claude Code web, mobile, and desktop sessions can run, on Team and Enterprise plans
- Added `archive` plugin source: install plugins from a zip over HTTPS without git or npm, with optional SHA-256 pinning
- Added a cancel-and-confirm step when removing an unavailable paste changes a command's text
- Added `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_REGION_PREFIX` env var for Bedrock to prefer a specific cross-region inference profile over the `AWS_REGION`-derived one
- Added `crossSessionInbound` and `dialogExpiry` settings: cross-session messages sent to a session running with bypassed permissions are held for your approval, and messages to other sessions auto-deliver
- Added sandbox credential-masking options: `extract` and `onExtractNoMatch` for structured env values, `decode: "jwt"` with `maskClaims` for JWT-aware masking, and `awsPairs`/`sigv4` for AWS SigV4 re-signing; these need `network.tlsTerminate` and are honored only from user, managed, or `--settings` settings
- Added cross-session `SendMessage`: Claude Code sessions can now message each other, on any of your machines, with `ListAgents` to discover them (macOS and Linux)
- Fixed long (>200 char) project paths resolving to another project's session directory under a shared sanitized prefix; session list, rename, fork, delete and `/resume` no longer cross projects
- Fixed `SendMessage` reporting "Message sent" when the write to a teammate's inbox had actually failed; failed deliveries are now reported as errors
- Fixed sandbox filesystem deny entries written with a trailing slash (e.g. `denyRead: "~/.aws/"`) being silently bypassable on Linux and macOS
- Fixed sandbox violation details never appearing in Bash tool results; Claude now sees which file or network access was denied and why
- Fixed MCP tools that connect mid-turn being deferred for tool search without their names announced to the model
- Fixed plugin install records being silently corrupted when the same plugin is installed in multiple projects
- Fixed recalled or restored paste content occasionally attaching wrong data or silently losing text when the paste had aged out or placeholder numbers collided
- Fixed copy-on-select on Wayland sometimes not reaching the clipboard; the two selection writes no longer race
- Fixed the feedback survey's transcript share silently failing on long sessions; a failed share now shows an error instead of a success message
- Fixed Remote Control auto-start intermittently failing with "Remote credentials fetch failed" on a cold start with a stale login token
- Fixed Remote Control and SDK clients showing a blank "(no content)" message after `/clear` and other output-less commands
- Fixed a Remote Control session recreated after its server session expired uploading prior local conversation history into the new session
- Improved fullscreen mode to keep the full pre-compaction history in scrollback across repeated compactions, instead of only the most recent interval
- Improved Remote Control: attached web and mobile clients now see compaction progress and the post-compaction boundary instead of a silent pause; `/clear` resets now propagate to attached clients
- Improved Remote Control: connection failures now show a persistent failure indicator with details and a reconnect shortcut, instead of only an 8-second toast
- Removed the 200-subagent-per-session spawn cap; long-running sessions no longer refuse new agents (concurrency and depth limits still apply)
- Changed managed settings: the approval prompt no longer re-appears after re-login or org switching when the organization's settings are unchanged
- Changed the feedback-survey transcript share: with your consent it now also uploads the last request's model settings — the system prompt (which includes your `CLAUDE.md` instructions), tool definitions, and model parameters. Secrets are redacted as before, and these fields are dropped first if the share is too large
- Changed the Bash tool description to always note that command output is displayed to the model, not reliably to the user
- Changed recalled paste placeholder numbers to renumber when accepted into the input
- Changed Remote Control to archive the stale server session instead of leaving a dead one listed when a fresh session is minted after compaction or `/resume`
- [VSCode] Fixed the extension showing Remote Control as connected after the connection failed
- Fixed a session resume silently reconnecting Remote Control after the user turned it off (`--resume`, SDK hosts, and the VS Code extension)
- [VSCode] Fixed sessions not honoring `remoteControlAtStartup` when explicitly enabled

## 2.1.223

- Added owner wildcard entries (`"owner/*"`) to the `strictKnownMarketplaces` and `blockedMarketplaces` managed settings for allowing or blocking all marketplace repos under a GitHub org
- Added a warning when workflow agents, forked skills, slash commands, or resumed background agents' requested subagent model is restricted and the parent model runs instead
- Added a `/teleport` hint in cloud sessions showing how to continue locally with `claude --teleport <session id>`
- Fixed a Bash permission bypass where a crafted command could hide parts of itself from permission checks
- Fixed permission prompts so commands padded with tabs or invisible Unicode can no longer hide part of the command from the approval dialog
- Fixed workflow scripts being able to use dynamic `import()` to run code outside the workflow sandbox
- Fixed a permission gap where an agent definition's `bypassPermissions` mode ignored the org bypass-permissions disable policy
- Fixed resuming a session after a mid-session `/cd` coming back empty
- Fixed gateway model discovery hiding Claude models registered under provider-prefixed IDs such as `vertex_ai/claude-*` or `bedrock/anthropic.claude-*`
- Fixed `modelOverrides` keys that aren't Anthropic model IDs being treated as the session's canonical model ID; unknown keys are now ignored as documented
- Fixed managed settings: server-delivered settings no longer disable the env block of a machine-local `managed-settings.json` or MDM profile; admin env now merges per key
- Fixed sandboxed commands failing to start on Linux when `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite` covers the working directory
- Fixed forked background agents getting stuck "already resuming" for the rest of the session when rebuilding the fork's parent prompt failed during resume
- Fixed a resumed session failing every turn, or leaving the interactive app on an unresponsive error screen, when its history held a malformed diagnostics attachment
- Fixed a rare hang when parsing unusual `git push` output
- Changed `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` to hold every Claude model with a native 1M window to 200K via auto-compaction, not just a fixed list; a startup warning now appears when auto-compaction isn't holding the session to 200K
- Changed auto-compact to keep sessions on unrecognized model IDs within the assumed context window instead of letting them grow past it; set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT=1` to restore the previous behavior
- Changed `/review` to be an alias of `/code-review`, which reviews the current diff or a PR (`/code-review <level> <pr#>`); use `/code-review ultra` for a deep cloud review
- Changed `/code-review` with no effort level to reuse the level you typed last; type a level like `/code-review high` to change it

## 2.1.222

- Fixed worktree-isolated sessions and their subagents being able to run destructive git commands against the main checkout; isolation now applies to file edits and Bash in every session type
- Fixed PreToolUse auto-allow hooks bypassing tool restrictions in background agent tasks (summaries, compaction, renames)
- Fixed `/usage-credits` on Team and Enterprise showing "you've already sent a usage credit request" for members whose earlier request was dismissed, blocking them from sending a new one
- Fixed the startup connectivity check hanging and then failing behind an HTTPS proxy; it now uses the same proxy-aware transport as API requests and times out with a clear message
- Fixed "Connection closed mid-response" errors being reported on responses that had actually completed
- Fixed `/usage` overattributing usage to MCP servers: a server's share now reflects only the requests that actually consumed its tool results, instead of every turn after any call to it
- Fixed sessions not linking to pull requests created after the branch was pushed, including through the GitHub REST API
- Fixed org-restricted `model: opus`-style subagent and teammate family aliases dropping to the parent model instead of stepping down to the newest org-allowed model in the family
- Fixed stream idle timeout firing on custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateways despite server keep-alive pings arriving on the wire
- Fixed claude.ai connectors being falsely marked as needing authorization when the session token is invalid — they now show a `/login` hint instead
- Fixed tool errors not being displayed for tools no longer available locally, for example after an MCP server is removed
- Fixed `SendMessage` rejecting a long summary — it now truncates instead, so sends no longer fail on a character limit
- Fixed the spinner's effort label in a subagent's transcript view showing the session's effort level instead of the subagent's own `effort:` setting
- Fixed rare crashes when a file watcher hit a filesystem error or during file-watcher teardown
- Fixed screen readers re-reading the whole input line on every backspace in `--ax-screen-reader` mode — end-of-line deletions now echo just the deleted characters
- Fixed host model-selection keys not taking precedence over a stale on-disk `managed-settings.json` when `CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST` is set
- Improved auto mode safety: messages sent to other agent sessions via `SendMessage` are now evaluated by the permission classifier before dispatch
- Improved the refusal when Claude tries to invoke a skill with `disable-model-invocation`: Claude is now told to ask you to run the skill instead of replicating its workflow
- Improved the `/diff` view, the Remote Control workspace diff, and file-edit diffs in Claude Code on the web sessions to use raw git blob content, ignoring workspace-configured diff drivers and textconv
- Changed Remote Control auto-start so repo-local settings (`.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) can no longer turn it on (they can still turn it off); enable it at user scope via `/config`
- Removed ultraplan feature

## 2.1.221

- [VSCode] Added Focus view: a chat-menu toggle that hides tool activity behind an expandable per-turn summary with a live running-tool indicator, toggled with `Ctrl+Alt+F` or the "Claude Code: Toggle Focus view" command
- Added `mode: "mask"` for sandbox credential files on Linux and WSL — sandboxed commands read a sentinel copy (the whole file, or just the spans captured by an `extract` regex) while the sandbox proxy substitutes the real value on egress; on macOS file masking falls back to `deny`
- Added warnings to `claude plugin validate` when a marketplace or plugin name would be rejected by Claude Desktop's managed marketplace sync
- Added a `prompt-audit` subcommand to the `claude-api` skill for auditing prompts and tool descriptions for patterns written for older models
- Fixed a Bash tool permission-check bypass where zsh could execute hidden commands in `[[ ]]` regex conditionals; affected commands now prompt for permission
- Fixed PowerShell permission checks mishandling paths containing quote characters on Windows; such paths now prompt for approval
- Fixed the thinking toggle having no effect for the rest of a session that started with thinking off; disabling an MCP server mid-connect no longer silently reverts
- Fixed MCP servers from `--mcp-config` not being connected before the first turn in print mode (`-p`), which made the model emit tool calls as literal text
- Fixed @-mentioned files being silently dropped when pressing Esc to retract a prompt and resubmitting it
- Fixed a crash when preparing API requests for SDK MCP tools named after built-in object properties such as `constructor`
- Fixed WebSearch failing with a 400 error at effort `xhigh`/`max` when thinking is disabled
- Fixed sandboxed large uploads failing with TLS errors through the sandbox proxy
- Fixed Team and Enterprise spend-limit message incorrectly blaming the org's monthly limit instead of your individual spend limit
- Fixed Bedrock authentication with AWS SSO named profiles failing in desktop-managed sessions on Windows machines that set a stray `HOME` environment variable
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_INTERRUPTED_TURN=0` not disabling interrupted-turn auto-resume; falsy values are now honored
- Fixed a rare wake-from-sleep race where two Claude Code processes could both refresh the same MCP connector or WIF OAuth token at once, forcing re-authentication
- Fixed renaming a session from Claude Code Desktop or claude.ai not updating the CLI's session name; session names from every rename surface are now sanitized
- Fixed plugin- and org-delivered skills named after terminal-only built-ins (e.g. `/help`, `/feedback`) being un-invocable in non-interactive sessions
- Fixed the "Plugins changed" notification lingering after plugins were reloaded instead of clearing
- Fixed Vim mode: the yank register now survives dialogs, history search, and the transcript view instead of being silently emptied
- Fixed Vim mode: undoing back to an empty prompt now arms the "press ← again" confirm before returning to the agent view
- Improved tool search on Google Vertex AI: re-enabled for Claude 4.5-generation and newer models
- Improved auto mode: permission checks for parallel tool calls are now cache-efficient, and switching modes while a check is pending reliably prompts instead of applying the stale result
- Reduced prompt-cache costs for auto-mode permission checks by reusing the cached conversation prefix across decisions
- Improved Stats panel to count cache tokens in its token totals, with a breakdown by input, output, cache read, and cache write
- Improved `/ultrareview` error messages when a repo shares no history with its base: a checkout with no branches is now refused up front with advice to create one, and refusal hints no longer suggest `git fetch --unshallow` on clones that are already complete
- Improved Windows startup: process creation times are now read via a native kernel32 call instead of spawning PowerShell, so endpoint security tools that gate `powershell.exe` no longer prompt
- Changed background sessions to commit and push to preserve work, open a draft PR only when the task calls for one, follow your CLAUDE.md git instructions, and always end by reporting where the work lives
- Changed `/plugin install` to refresh a stale marketplace catalog and retry before reporting a plugin not found
- Changed plugins installed from `/plugin` to activate immediately when safe, instead of always requiring `/reload-plugins`
- Changed plugins to accept `"."` as a `skills` path, and the root-level `SKILL.md` validation error now suggests using the plugin root
- Changed `/status` to show the session kind: `interactive`, or a background job that is `attached` or `unattended`
- Changed emoji autocomplete to accept common alternate shortcodes like `:thumbsup:`, `:thumbsdown:`, and `:love:`
- Changed sessions forked with `/fork` to create a new worktree of their own instead of working in the original session's checkout
- Changed Claude in Chrome to close the browser tabs it opens once it no longer needs them
- Changed fast mode to report on the stream when usage credits run out mid-session, instead of failing silently
- Changed Monitor: a watch that exits without producing any output now says so instead of reporting "stream ended"
- Changed the Gateway `model` field validation: non-string values are rejected with a 400 instead of being forwarded
- Removed the repeated "Permission mode changed while the auto-mode classifier call was queued" notice from approval prompts

## 2.1.220

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.219

- Added Claude Opus 5 (`claude-opus-5`), now the default Opus model — 1M context, fast mode at $10/$50 per Mtok
- Added `sandbox.network.strictAllowlist` setting to deny non-allowlisted hosts for sandboxed commands without prompting
- Added `DirectoryAdded` hook that fires after `/add-dir` or the SDK `register_repo_root` control request registers a new working directory mid-session
- Added `mcp_server_errors` to the headless stream-json init event, listing `--mcp-config` entries skipped by config validation; terminal runs print a startup warning
- Added the `workflowSizeGuideline` settings key so the advisory Dynamic workflow size guideline can be set from any settings file; the `/config` row is hidden while one does
- Added nested subagent forwarding in stream-json: subagents spawned at depth-2+ now appear when `--forward-subagent-text` is set, keyed by their spawning Agent `tool_use` id
- Fixed `claude -p` text output dropping the answer already produced when a turn dies on a mid-stream API error
- Added HTTP status and error text to `claude mcp list` and `/mcp` when a server fails to connect, and a warning for MCP config values with hidden leading or trailing whitespace
- Fixed the Fable model row showing "Requires usage credits" for plans that include it, when a stale cache had baked the label in
- Fixed the `/model` picker showing the merged Opus row as plain "Opus" instead of "Opus (1M context)"
- Fixed copy-on-select inside GNU screen printing base64 into the terminal instead of copying the selection
- Fixed Remote Control clients keeping a stale fast-mode status after a model switch, reconnect, or failed org check
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH` on Windows exiting or being used as bash when the path isn't a bash/sh binary; it's now ignored with a warning
- Fixed Vim mode: pressing ← on an empty prompt now returns to the agent view from NORMAL mode, not just INSERT
- Fixed screen-reader mode rewriting the entire input line on every keystroke instead of echoing only the typed character
- Improved the "Remote Control is only available via api.anthropic.com" error to name the specific setting that caused it
- Improved `claude --teleport` to show which repo your current checkout points at when it doesn't match the session's repo
- Changed dynamic workflows to default to a medium size guideline (aim for fewer than 15 agents); pick another size or unrestricted with Dynamic workflow size in `/config`
- Changed managed MCP allowlist/denylist `${VAR}` entries to resolve from the startup environment and managed-settings env instead of settings-file env
- Changed the `/model` picker to highlight only the newest model's name, so the highlight marks the new release rather than an arbitrary subset of the list
- Added the current default workflow size to the running-workflow status line, with a pointer to `/config` for changing it
- Removed Opus 4.7 from fast mode; `/fast` now applies to Opus 5 and Opus 4.8
- Updated the claude-api skill to default to Claude Opus 5, with a migration path from Opus 4.8
- Subagents can now spawn nested subagents up to depth 3 by default (was 1); set CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH=1 to disable nesting

## 2.1.218

- Changed `/code-review` to run as a background subagent, so review work no longer fills your conversation and keeps stacked slash commands as its review target
- Added screen-reader announcements of deleted text for word and line deletions (`Option+Delete`, `Ctrl+W`, `Cmd+Backspace`, `Ctrl+U`, `Ctrl+K`) in `--ax-screen-reader` mode
- Fixed Windows paths with `\u`-prefixed segments (like `C:\Users\unicorn`) being corrupted into CJK characters in tool inputs, which made those files inaccessible
- Fixed the left arrow key discarding the conversation with no undo: presses right after editing now ask to confirm, and Esc in the agent view returns to the conversation it backgrounded
- Fixed multi-line paste collapsing into one line with `j` in place of newlines in terminals that encode pasted newlines as Ctrl+J
- Fixed `/context` reporting stale pre-compact token usage after compacting from the message picker
- Fixed `/ultrareview` failing on descriptive arguments like "review my auth changes" — they now run a review of your current branch with the text applied as a note to the findings
- Fixed `/code-review ultra` silently running a local review in non-interactive sessions — it now launches the cloud review
- Fixed gateway spend metering to price Bedrock application-inference-profile ARNs and other config-mapped upstream model IDs at the configured model's rates
- Fixed mojibake when a long IDE selection was truncated mid-emoji, and a case where a tool executor error could be silently dropped
- Fixed an engine teardown race that could start and abandon a phantom turn, and made input pushed after close consistently rejected
- Fixed spurious "[Request interrupted by user]" messages after interrupted tool calls, and an unpaired `tool_use` block left in the transcript when a tool aborted mid-response
- Fixed VoiceOver reading "new line" instead of echoing the typed space at the end of the input in `--ax-screen-reader` mode
- Fixed plugin and settings panels not moving the terminal cursor to the focused row, so screen readers and magnifiers can follow arrow-key navigation
- Fixed crashes (maximum call stack exceeded) when a deeply nested watched directory tree was deleted or moved, and when rendering deeply nested UI trees
- Fixed pull request events occasionally being lost when a session exited immediately after creating or linking a PR
- Fixed the Bedrock setup wizard failing profile verification for assume-role profiles in partitioned AWS regions and on proxy-only networks
- Fixed rare negative or incorrect turn duration measurements after a system clock adjustment by timing turns with a monotonic clock
- Fixed the "N MCP servers need authentication" startup notice over-counting claude.ai connectors that aren't connected in claude.ai
- Fixed prompt history entries being dropped or duplicated when history writes raced or failed
- Fixed a retry loop that re-sent identical doomed requests after a context-overflow error with a large thinking budget; `Ctrl+B` backgrounding now applies the same background-shell caps as other paths
- Fixed agent frontmatter hooks running from untrusted folders: hooks now require the agent file's own folder to have accepted workspace trust
- Fixed fork-session lineage being lost after compaction in headless and SDK sessions
- Fixed a resumed session failing every turn, or crashing on resume, when its history held a malformed delta attachment
- Improved `/ultrareview` error feedback so Claude can correct an invalid argument instead of retrying it unchanged
- Improved auto mode: the dangerous-rm, background-`&`, and suspicious-Windows-path checks no longer open permission dialogs; the auto-mode classifier adjudicates them instead
- Improved sandbox command restrictions for IDE interactions
- Improved trust dialogs to name the repository root the grant covers
- Changed `/deep-research` to start only when invoked manually; Claude no longer launches it on its own
- Changed plan mode with auto to no longer prompt for Bash commands the static analyzer can't prove read-only; the auto-mode classifier judges them instead
- Added an announcement when fast mode changes as a result of switching models via `/config model=<x>` or Remote Control
- Changed server-managed settings so benign feature and cost toggles no longer trigger the settings-approval prompt
- Changed agent markdown files to reject agent names containing `:`, which is reserved for plugin namespacing
- Changed skills with `context: fork` to run in the background by default; opt out per skill with `background: false`
- Added `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off`/`1`/`0` (case-insensitive) as accepted values for skill and plugin frontmatter booleans, alongside `true`/`false`
- Fixed remote sessions continuing to send heartbeats after their worker was replaced, which left long-lived desktop and IDE processes retrying a rejected request every few seconds forever

## 2.1.217

- Added emoji shortcode autocomplete in the prompt input: type `:heart:` to insert ❤️, or `:hea` for suggestions — disable with the `emojiCompletionEnabled` setting
- Added warnings when transcript writes are failing (e.g. disk full) or when session saving is off due to an inherited environment variable, instead of losing transcripts silently
- Fixed a memory leak where truncated MCP tool outputs kept the full untruncated result in memory for the rest of the session
- Fixed Windows auto-update failures that could leave `claude.exe` missing; failed updates now restore the preserved executable automatically
- Fixed background session isolation not canonicalizing symlinked working directories, which could let sessions escape their workspace folder
- Fixed auto-compact never triggering for Claude Opus 4.8 on Bedrock and `/compact` failing once over the limit
- Fixed corporate mTLS, TLS-verify, OAuth scope, and proxy settings being ignored in Claude Desktop sessions
- Fixed screen reader mode's startup announcement being cut off by the first prompt render, and the thinking status row re-rendering every few seconds to update elapsed time and token counts
- Fixed managed settings that set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` not governing all signals — lower-scope signal-specific overrides no longer redirect telemetry away from the managed endpoint
- Fixed `--resume`/`--continue` and `/resume` failing with a TypeError when a transcript has a malformed attachment entry
- Fixed Remote Control sessions not showing a pending permission prompt or dialog to viewers that connected after it appeared
- Fixed background shells sometimes becoming impossible to stop after a session is sent to the background (`/background` or `←`) or when the session exits on a heavily loaded machine, most visible on Windows
- Fixed a `CLAUDE.md` or `SKILL.md` paths frontmatter value with many brace groups OOM-killing or stalling the CLI at startup — brace expansion is now budget-bounded
- Fixed the transcript preview sitting flush against the input area when attaching to a starting background session; it now leaves the same one-line gap as the live layout, so the transcript no longer shifts when the session takes over
- Improved footer PR badge links to be clickable hyperlinks even when terminal support can't be detected (e.g. over ssh/tmux); set `FORCE_HYPERLINK=0` to opt out
- Changed the login-expiry warning to appear 3 days before expiry instead of 5
- Capped the frontend-design plugin suggestion tip at 3 lifetime impressions instead of repeating indefinitely
- Added a cap on concurrently-running subagents (default 20, override with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS`) so one message can't fan out unbounded background agents
- Changed subagents to no longer spawn nested subagents by default; set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` to allow deeper nesting
- Fixed `--max-budget-usd` not stopping background subagents: once the cap is reached, new spawns are denied and running background agents are halted

## 2.1.216

- Added `sandbox.filesystem.disabled` setting to skip filesystem isolation while keeping network egress control
- Fixed a slowdown in long sessions where message normalization cost grew quadratically with the number of turns, causing multi-second stalls and slow resumes
- Fixed auto mode denying commands with "HTTP 401" classifier errors after the OAuth token expired or rotated mid-session
- Fixed AskUserQuestion telling Claude to continue even when your answer asked it to wait or explain first — free-text answers now get neutral wording
- Fixed Claude Code on the web re-asking the same question and dropping your answer after the session sat idle for a few minutes
- Fixed @-mentions silently attaching nothing after file-modifying hooks, vim dot-repeat of `c`-operators and paste, statusline running twice on resume, and resume-picker hangs on failure
- Fixed resumed background agent sessions reverting to the default agent: the agent's prompt and tool restrictions are now restored
- Fixed worktree-isolated subagents redirecting git into the shared checkout via `git -C`, `--git-dir`, or `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`
- Fixed worktree sessions landing in another project's leftover worktree when the working directory did not match the selected project
- Fixed background sessions whose worktree has no git repository being undeletable
- Fixed `claude daemon stop --any` potentially terminating an unrelated process via a stale legacy daemon lockfile
- Fixed Esc-Esc at an idle prompt not opening the rewind picker in long-running sessions with background tasks
- Fixed Bash command permission checking for compound statements with redirects inside `&&` lists or negations
- Fixed pressing Ctrl+X twice in the agent list failing to delete a session, and deleted sessions reappearing when their background worker had died
- Fixed background subagents getting cancelled when a high-priority message arrives during their startup window
- Fixed mouse and focus garbage in the terminal while a GUI editor from `/memory`, `/plan`, `/keybindings`, or Ctrl+G is open; `/memory` no longer waits for the editor to close
- Fixed Claude-in-Chrome 403-looping on reconnect when the session's OAuth token lacks a required scope
- Fixed workflow saves and scheduled-task writes following a symlink at `.claude`, which could redirect writes outside the project
- Fixed MCP re-authenticate revoking working credentials before the new sign-in succeeds, and the reconnect needs-auth message in background sessions pointing at an unusable command
- Fixed read-only commands on Windows accessing network paths without a permission prompt
- Fixed Bash command parsing of non-ASCII characters to match real shell word boundaries
- Fixed PowerShell tool permission validation of commands containing invisible Unicode characters
- Fixed dialogs in fullscreen mode stretching past the right-hand edge of their panel
- Fixed the `/config` settings list in fullscreen mode clipping its keyboard-hint footer
- Fixed the transcript-mode (Ctrl+O) footer hint wrapping on terminals narrower than 104 columns
- Fixed the Prometheus metrics endpoint (`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=prometheus`) emitting invalid `# UNIT` lines
- Fixed skills and commands changed during a session not appearing in the slash menu until restart
- Fixed plugin skills with a `name` frontmatter field losing their plugin prefix in slash-command autocomplete
- Fixed telemetry misreporting permission denials: failed permission-prompt requests no longer count as user rejections, and user interrupts are now reported as user aborts instead of rejections
- Improved the `/fork` confirmation to one line with the new session's name, `claude attach` id, and a note when the copy shares your checkout
- Improved validation of `git` and `gh` command arguments in the PowerShell tool
- Improved the `/ultrareview` diff-too-large error to show configured limits, measured diff size, and largest contributing files
- Improved `/code-review ultra` empty-diff message to name the exact base ref and suggest passing an explicit base
- Improved the spend limit adjustment prompt to show the server's reason when a spend limit change is rejected
- `/context` now shows an explicit warning when the conversation exceeds the context window, and a failed `/compact` displays as an error
- `/rewind` no longer restores or deletes files through symlinks or hard links at tracked paths and reports how many paths it skipped
- Background sessions: `/mcp` and `/install-github-app` now park a "needs input" request in the agent view when no client is attached
- Updated the bundled dataviz skill: reordered the default chart palette and fixed guidance that suggested direct labels for four-series charts
- [VSCode] Fixed right-to-left text (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian) rendering in the wrong order when mixed with English or code
- Fixed cloud sessions dropping the in-flight message when the session's container restarts mid-turn — the interrupted turn now re-runs on resume instead of leaving the session unresponsive

## 2.1.215

- Claude no longer runs the `/verify` and `/code-review` skills on its own; invoke them with `/verify` or `/code-review` when you want them

## 2.1.214

- Fixed single-segment `dir/**` allow rules like `Edit(src/**)` auto-approving writes to nested `dir/` directories anywhere in the tree instead of only `<cwd>/dir`
- Fixed a permission-check bypass affecting commands run in Windows PowerShell 5.1 sessions
- Fixed Bash permission checks to fail closed on file-descriptor redirect forms that bash parses differently than the permission analyzer
- Fixed Bash permission checks misjudging very long commands — commands over 10,000 characters now always prompt instead of running automatically
- Fixed Bash permission checks treating zsh variable subscripts and modifiers in `[[ ]]` comparisons as inert text — these commands now prompt for approval
- Fixed Bash permission checks to no longer auto-approve certain `help` and `man` commands that could run unsafe options, command substitutions, or backslash paths
- Fixed permission prompts on remote sessions that could proceed before the local confirmation dialog
- Added the EndConversation tool: Claude can end sessions with highly abusive users or jailbreak attempts, as on claude.ai since 2025 — see https://www.anthropic.com/research/end-subset-conversations
- Added a periodic progress heartbeat for long-running tool calls that previously went silent
- Added an ISO `modified` timestamp to memory file frontmatter
- Added `message.uuid`, `client_request_id`, and `tool_source` attributes to OpenTelemetry log events for message-level correlation and tool provenance
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_CONTENT_MAX_LENGTH` to configure the 60 KB truncation limit on OpenTelemetry content attributes
- Added reasoning effort to the `subagentStatusLine` payload, so custom agent rows can render model and effort
- Added permission prompts for `docker` commands (including the Podman `docker` shim) carrying daemon-redirect flags (`--url`, `--connection`, `--identity`, and Podman's remote mode) that previously ran without one
- Fixed a crash when a GrowthBook feature evaluates to null, and a bug where a malformed flag payload could wipe the cached feature flags
- Fixed Bash tool killing the Claude session when a `pkill -f` pattern accidentally matched the CLI's own process (Linux)
- Fixed unbounded memory growth when `--settings` points at a device file or multi-GB file; oversized (>2 MiB) settings files now fail at startup with a clear error
- Fixed streaming turns failing with "Socket is closed" behind corporate proxies on Windows
- Fixed stream-json output truncation at exit for slow-reading SDK/pipeline consumers; the exit drain now scales with queued bytes instead of a flat 2s cap
- Fixed scheduled tasks refusing their own configured prompt as untrusted input — the fired prompt is now delivered as the session's assigned task
- Fixed PowerShell tool commands hanging until timeout when a child process waited on standard input (Windows)
- Fixed Python scripts under the PowerShell tool crashing with UnicodeDecodeError when reading non-UTF-8 data from standard input (Windows)
- Fixed Python scripts run via the PowerShell tool crashing with UnicodeEncodeError on non-ASCII output, and PowerShell 7 error messages containing raw ANSI escape sequences (Windows)
- Fixed the PowerShell tool reporting `where.exe`, `fc.exe`, and `diff.exe` as errors when they return a valid negative answer (Windows)
- Fixed `>` and `>>` under the PowerShell tool on Windows PowerShell 5.1 writing UTF-16LE files that other tools couldn't read as UTF-8
- Fixed a displaced background daemon deleting its successor's control socket on shutdown, which made the next client kill the healthy replacement daemon
- Fixed background sessions parked with `←` or `/background` and left idle keeping the background daemon and a worker process alive indefinitely
- Fixed completed background sessions being impossible to remove via `claude rm` or the agent view once the background service had gone idle
- Fixed background sessions dispatched from a non-git folder being impossible to delete from the agents view
- Fixed reopening a stopped background session failing to restore its saved conversation when an unreadable folder exists in the session store
- Fixed the Remote Control "session ready" push notification firing for sessions where Remote Control was not explicitly enabled
- Fixed `/install-github-app` and the `/mcp` settings menu being blocked in agent-view sessions — they're now refused only in background sessions with no terminal attached
- Fixed plugins enabled via the `--settings` CLI flag not loading (regression since v2.1.181)
- Fixed feature flags going stale in long-running sessions after the OAuth token rotates
- Fixed `/ultrareview` refusing to run in repos with no merge base — it now offers to review all tracked files
- Fixed `claude update` and `claude doctor` hanging silently, and the `/status` System diagnostics section going blank, when a shell-config path is a directory
- Fixed memory frontmatter values being silently truncated at an inline `#` when memory files are saved
- Fixed session cost and token telemetry double-counting on streams that emit multiple cumulative `message_delta` frames
- Fixed a spurious "check your network" warning that appeared while the advisor was thinking
- Fixed hooks with exit code 2 not blocking as documented when the hook's stdout JSON fails schema validation
- Fixed OTel log events emitted outside the turn's async context missing the interaction span's trace context
- Fixed MCP transient errors during prompts/resources refresh clearing the server's slash commands and resources
- Improved the `claude rc` workspace-trust error in the home directory to say trust there is never saved and to suggest running from a project directory
- Changed single-segment `dir/**` hook `if:` conditions to match only `<cwd>/dir`; write `**/dir/**` for any-depth matching. `deny`/`ask` permission rules keep their any-depth match.
- Changed `file` commands using `-m`/`--magic-file` or `-f`/`--files-from` to require permission instead of being auto-allowed as read-only
- Changed keep-alive connection pooling to disable after a stale-connection error, so retries open a fresh socket
- Changed SessionStart hooks to report source `"fork"` when a session begins as a fork instead of `"resume"`

## 2.1.212

- `/fork` now copies your conversation into a new background session (its own row in `claude agents`) while you keep working; the in-session subagent it used to launch is now `/subtask`
- Added `claude auto-mode reset` to restore the default auto-mode configuration, with a confirmation prompt (pass `--yes` to skip)
- Added a session-wide limit on WebSearch tool calls (default 200, tunable via `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION`) to stop runaway search loops
- Added a per-session cap on subagent spawns (default 200, override with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION`) to stop runaway delegation loops; `/clear` resets the budget
- MCP tool calls running longer than 2 minutes now move to the background automatically so the session stays usable; configure the threshold or disable with `CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_AUTO_BACKGROUND_MS`
- Typing `/resume` in the agent view now opens a picker of past sessions — including sessions deleted from the list — and resumes your pick as a background session
- Fixed plan mode auto-running file-modifying Bash commands (e.g. `touch`, `rm`) without a permission prompt or SDK `canUseTool` callback
- Fixed worktree creation following a repository-committed symlink at `.claude/worktrees`, which could create files outside the repository
- Fixed a `continue:false` hook's halt being dropped when the tool fails or completes mid-stream, and hook infrastructure errors being misreported as user rejections
- Fixed SIGTERM during a running Bash tool orphaning the command's process tree in print/SDK mode; the CLI now aborts the turn, kills the tree, and exits 143
- Fixed `/background` and `claude --bg` failing with "EUNKNOWN: unknown error, uv_spawn" on Windows when Group Policy blocks PowerShell 5.1; the daemon now prefers PowerShell 7
- Fixed shell mode (`!`) not executing commands containing file paths while the path autocomplete popup was open
- Fixed auto-mode denial notifications rendering broken characters when a long denial reason was truncated mid-emoji
- Fixed Ctrl+J not inserting a newline in the agent view dispatch input on terminals with extended key reporting, and surfaced the newline shortcut in the `?` help overlay
- Fixed `/ultrareview` rejecting PR references like `#123`, `PR 123`, and pasted PR URLs; error hints now name the command you actually typed
- Fixed `/ultrareview <branch>` not fetching the branch from origin when it exists remotely; it now suggests the closest branch name on typos
- Fixed `/ultrareview` skipping the billing confirmation in a new conversation after `/clear`
- Fixed `/ultrareview`'s "not a git repository" error on Claude Desktop now suggesting the project's repository folder instead of terminal commands
- Fixed hosted (host-managed) sessions failing at startup when repository settings configured mTLS certs, extra CA bundles, or OAuth scopes; these transport settings are now ignored with a warning
- Fixed a spurious "File has not been read yet" error when editing a file that had been read with offset/limit before resuming a session
- Fixed `ExitWorktree` failing with "no active EnterWorktree session" after resuming a session with `--continue`/`--resume` in print/SDK mode
- Fixed the workflow agent grid staying empty for Remote Control clients that join a session mid-run
- Fixed streaming-mode control requests being marked complete before their handler finished, which could lose the request on session restart
- Fixed background sessions created with `/fork` losing their live-parent protection after a state write failure
- Fixed reopening a stopped background session from the agent view failing silently — it now resumes the session, or shows why it can't and lets you force a restart
- Fixed agent teams: a stopping teammate could send the leader duplicate idle notifications when team initialization re-ran within a session
- Fixed the plan-approval dialog footer splitting "ctrl+g to edit in <editor>" apart when the file path is long
- Fixed the welcome banner keeping its old panel widths after a combined width+height terminal resize in fullscreen mode
- Fixed diff previews losing their line numbers and +/- markers in narrow layouts
- Fixed @-mentions attaching nothing after a partial file read, plugin uninstall targeting the wrong marketplace, and false "Command timed out" on exit code 143
- Fixed OpenTelemetry HTTP exports being rejected with 411/400 by Azure Monitor and other endpoints that don't accept chunked transfer encoding
- Fixed OTLP event log records missing `trace_id`/`span_id` when `TRACEPARENT` is set in SDK/headless mode
- Fixed conversations with many images incorrectly failing with "Request too large" errors, and improved the error message to explain the actual cause
- Fixed web search and web fetch returning "API Error" text as search results or page content when the API was overloaded
- Improved web search and web fetch reliability by retrying 529 errors and rate-limited requests with bounded backoff
- Improved prompt caching: the mid-conversation system block now works behind LLM gateways and custom base URLs (Bedrock, Vertex, 1P)
- Improved background agent attach: cold-attaching now instantly shows the formatted transcript while the session boots, instead of a blank wait
- Reduced token usage in inter-agent messaging: `SendMessage` bodies are no longer duplicated into replayed history and tool results
- Changed `/fork` to name the copy after your prompt when the session has no title, so the row is recognizable in the agent view
- Changed bare `/btw` to reopen the side-question panel on your most recent exchange so you can browse earlier answers
- Changed the `←` footer hint to pulse `N done` for a moment when a background agent finishes while nothing needs your input
- Deprecated the Task tool's `mode` parameter (now ignored); subagents inherit the parent session's permission mode by default
- Changed Enterprise `forceLoginMethod` to be enforced for VS Code extension, SDK, `setup-token`, and `install-github-app` logins, not just the terminal
- Changed session transcripts to record the reasoning effort level on each assistant message
- Changed headless/SDK sessions to apply a `set_model` control request mid-turn; the next model round-trip uses the new model instead of waiting for the next turn
- Changed agent view / `claude agents --json`: sessions waiting on a sandbox, MCP-input, or managed-settings prompt now show as "Needs input" instead of "Working"
- Updated the auth status panel title from "Cloud authentication" to "Authentication"
- Corrected an earlier release note (2.1.200): tmux through the 3.6 series lacks synchronized output; newer tmux with support is detected automatically

## 2.1.211

- Added `--forward-subagent-text` flag and `CLAUDE_CODE_FORWARD_SUBAGENT_TEXT` environment variable to include subagent text and thinking in stream-json output
- Fixed permission previews relayed to chat channels not neutralizing bidirectional-override, zero-width, and look-alike quote characters, so tool inputs cannot visually alter the approval message
- Fixed auto mode overriding a PreToolUse hook's `ask` decision for unsandboxed Bash — a hook `ask` now floors the decision at a prompt
- Fixed parallel Claude Code sessions all logging out simultaneously after wake-from-sleep when many sessions share one credential store
- Fixed plugin MCP servers not reconnecting after an idle web session woke, leaving MCP calls failing until the next message
- Fixed Claude Code on Vertex and Bedrock attempting the default Opus model at startup and printing a spurious fallback notice when a model is explicitly configured
- Fixed subagents spawned with an explicit model override reverting to the parent's model when resumed or sent a follow-up message
- Fixed nested `.claude/rules/*.md` files loading even when setting sources exclude project settings
- Fixed file upload validation: filenames ending in a DOS device suffix (`.prn`) or trailing dot are now accepted, and files with multiple hard links are refused
- Fixed file uploads to Claude in Chrome from remote and CLI sessions
- Fixed edits that leave the input as "?" being silently swallowed and toggling the shortcuts panel
- Fixed a startup hang when the Claude in Chrome extension is enabled but Chrome is not running
- Fixed a 300ms delay revealing async content (Settings tabs, Stats, diff views, and other loading states)
- Fixed reopening a just-stopped background session from the agents view starting a blank conversation under the same session id
- Fixed `/loop` hiding the session from `/resume` after a single use
- Fixed screen reader users losing the audible terminal bell after `/terminal-setup` or onboarding terminal setup
- Fixed background jobs on LLM gateway auth (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) coming back "Not logged in" after the daemon respawns them
- Fixed `claude agents` jobs becoming permanently undeletable when git no longer recognizes their worktree — the row now shows why the delete was refused instead of silently reappearing
- Fixed `/clear` not resetting the session cost counter — the statusline's cost now starts at $0 after `/clear`
- Fixed Claude in Chrome setup pages failing to open in the browser on Windows
- Fixed headless print-mode sessions on Windows crashing or silently exiting when stdin is unreadable
- Fixed background session titles in the agents view showing the naming model's refusal text when the prompt contains a link
- Fixed background agents killed by the user auto-respawning, and revived agents re-running stale prompts from old sessions
- Fixed routines with no schedule reporting a next run time in the year 1
- Hardened synced skill/plugin directory naming on Windows and kept CCR web fetch/search proxies working after `/clear`
- Improved terminal layout and rendering performance
- Improved background agent result reporting — Claude now reports the status of still-running agents and waits for the real completion instead of fabricating results
- Improved the memory index over-limit warning to measure only loaded content, excluding frontmatter and HTML comments
- Updated integer environment variables (timeouts, token budgets, retry counts) to accept scientific notation and digit-separator spellings like `1e6` and `64_000`
- Updated documentation links to the current docs sites
- Changed "always allow" permission rules to save at the repository root, so approvals granted in a git worktree persist across sessions and worktrees
- Changed `/usage-credits` to ask for confirmation before sending a request to organization admins
- Changed Vim mode `s` and `S` (substitute char/line) to work in NORMAL mode, matching vim behavior
- [VSCode] Updated the Remote Control banner to describe what it does
- Claude in Chrome: hardened file-upload path validation
- Claude in Chrome: `save_to_disk` on screenshot actions now writes the image to disk and returns the path; previously it did nothing
- Fixed a prompt-caching regression on Bedrock, Vertex, Mantle, and Foundry that billed the trailing system context block as fresh input tokens on every request.

## 2.1.210

- Added a live elapsed-time counter to the collapsed tool summary line so long-running tool calls visibly tick instead of looking stuck
- Added a startup warning for `Write(path)`, `NotebookEdit(path)`, and `Glob(path)` permission rules — use `Edit(path)` or `Read(path)` instead
- Fixed `isolation: 'worktree'` subagents being able to run git-mutating commands against the main repo checkout instead of their own isolated worktree
- Fixed the `ultracode` keyword opt-in firing on non-human-originated input such as webhook payloads and relayed PR comments
- Fixed a rendered text fragment leaking into crash telemetry when a UI component returned content outside a styled text element
- Fixed paste markers leaking into external editors opened from Claude Code, which could appear as stray È/É characters around pasted text
- Fixed `claude attach` sometimes failing with "job not found" or "agent is still starting" errors during session transitions — attach now waits for the daemon to settle, and terminal resizes during a slow attach are applied once it completes
- Fixed a session crash when a tool's result renderer returned a numeric bigint value or plain text instead of a UI element
- Fixed a hook callback timeout being misreported to the model as a user rejection, which made unattended sessions stop and wait
- Fixed Claude assuming a `cd` took effect after its command was moved to the background; the tool result now states the working directory is unchanged
- Fixed plugin-provided MCP servers being torn down when MCP servers are re-synced mid-session
- Fixed plan approvals without edits being labeled "(edited by user)" and overwriting the plan file with a stale snapshot
- Fixed `/doctor` skipping its auto-mode-default proposal on Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, where auto mode no longer needs an opt-in
- Fixed Grep content mode claiming "No matches found" when paginating past the end of results
- Fixed unmatched `$1`/`$2` positional placeholders in skills and commands being silently stripped; they are now preserved verbatim
- Fixed plugin cache writes leaving temp files behind on failure and failing on locked-file renames on Windows and network filesystems
- Fixed background workers crash-looping when a client resets its connection to the background service
- Fixed `claude agents --effort ultracode` not reaching dispatched sessions; the value was silently dropped
- Fixed pressing ← to open the agents view dropping the task tracker when returning to the session
- Fixed the agents dashboard retaining pasted images from abandoned reply drafts after their session was deleted
- Fixed killed background sessions leaving a permanent `git worktree lock` behind; the periodic sweep now releases locks whose owning process is gone
- Fixed SDK MCP servers registered via an `initialize` control request waiting until the next turn to start connecting
- Fixed returning to the agents view from a session leaving overlapping ghost frames with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`
- Fixed late-appearing `.claude/*` symlinks not being reconciled into the sandbox deny-write list
- Hardened the Agent tool against indirect prompt injection via content a subagent read
- Improved the Bash/PowerShell tool message when a command hits its timeout and is auto-backgrounded, so the model can distinguish a hang from an explicit background request
- Improved auto mode: the permission classifier now defaults to Sonnet 5 for external sessions, validated on the session's first request and pinned for the session
- Improved the bundled dataviz skill's chart color validation with perceptual OKLab color difference and recalibrated color-blindness thresholds
- Memory writes that leave a MEMORY.md index over its read limit now produce an explicit error instead of silent truncation
- Screen reader mode now announces permission mode changes aloud when cycling modes with Shift+Tab
- The agents footer hint now shows how many background agents are waiting on your input, with a brief color emphasis when the count changes
- Agent view: the session you pressed ← from stays visibly marked even after mouse hover or arrow keys move the selection
- Fable temporarily shows as unavailable in the advisor picker while a server-side issue causing Fable advisor failures is fixed

## 2.1.209

- Fixed /model and other dialogs being blocked in `claude agents` background sessions (reverts an overly broad guard)

## 2.1.208

- Added screen reader mode: opt-in plain-text rendering for screen reader users. Run `claude --ax-screen-reader`, set CLAUDE_AX_SCREEN_READER=1, or add "axScreenReader": true to settings.
- Added `vimInsertModeRemaps` setting: map two-key insert-mode sequences like `jj` to Escape in vim mode
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_PROCESS_WRAPPER`: agent view and the background service now honor a corporate launcher by running every Claude Code self-spawn through a required wrapper executable
- Added mouse-click support for multi-select menus and "Other" input rows in fullscreen mode
- Changed the Fable 5 usage-credits consent prompt to start with the decline option focused
- Fixed fast mode staying off after switching back to a model that supports it — it now restores automatically when enabled in settings
- Fixed replies typed to a background agent being lost when delivery fails — the text is now saved and delivered when the session restarts
- Fixed background-session attach failing permanently ("Couldn't start the background daemon") after an update replaced the binary a running `claude agents` process was launched from
- Fixed the context window (and auto-compact indicator) briefly resetting to 200k after the CLI auto-updates, causing a false "100% context used" when resuming long-context sessions
- Fixed supervised and background sessions crashing when a server closed an HTTP/2 connection with a GOAWAY while requests were in flight
- Fixed truncated stream-json/JSON output and missing result message when piping large responses from `claude -p`
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` and similar env vars silently using the mantissa of scientific-notation values (`1e6` became `1`)
- Fixed very large markdown tables stalling rendering or using excessive memory; tables over 200 rows show the first 200 with a "… N more rows" notice
- Fixed the Edit tool failing on files modified after reading when the target text still matches uniquely
- Fixed Read reporting empty files as "shorter than offset", Grep silently returning "No files found" for invalid regex patterns, Grep count mode under-reporting totals when paginated, and Glob crashing with an unclear error when the pattern, path, or working directory contained a null byte
- Fixed `apiKeyHelper` script failures being hidden behind a generic 401 after ~10 silent retries; the script's own error is now shown within 3 attempts
- Fixed Bedrock streaming requests failing with a misleading "Truncated event message received" when a gateway transforms the response — the error now names the content-type and points at the proxy
- Fixed `/upgrade` showing a login flow instead of the upgrade URL when the browser fails to open
- Fixed stream-json input killing the session on blank CRLF or whitespace-only lines from Windows-style SDK hosts
- Fixed headless stream-json sessions hanging permanently when a `control_request` carried a non-string `set_model` payload; the CLI now answers with an error response
- Fixed repeated "No completion record was found" notices on session resume — orphaned background tasks now collapse into a single summary
- Fixed Remote Control clients attaching to a terminal-hosted session not seeing background agents and workflow progress until a task started or stopped
- Fixed the Agent tool launching with no tools when a subagent's `tools` list resolves to nothing — it now returns a clear error naming the unrecognized entries
- Fixed `/usage` showing stale cached bars over fresher data, and `/mcp` not reclassifying placeholder servers after config edits
- Fixed "Change directory" in SDK hosts (e.g. Claude Desktop) failing with "A turn is in progress" on idle sessions that have a running background task
- Fixed the workflow save dialog showing `~/.claude/workflows/` instead of the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` location for user-scope saves
- Fixed `/release-notes` adding the viewed notes to the model's context — "Show all" previously injected the entire changelog into every subsequent request
- Fixed a memory leak in the agent view where pasted images were retained for the screen's lifetime after sending peek replies
- Fixed SDK sessions losing agents defined via the initialize request when a plugin refresh ran before the client attached
- Fixed several memory leaks in long sessions: MCP stdio server stderr accumulating up to 64 MB per server, LSP documents staying open indefinitely (now LRU with 50-doc cap), async hook output retained after backgrounding, and unbounded growth in headless/SDK sessions from large tool-result payloads
- Fixed a memory blowup when reading files with extremely long single lines using offset/limit — the read now returns a clean error instead of loading the whole line
- Fixed multi-second per-turn slowdowns in sessions with many permission deny/ask rules — rule matchers are now compiled once and cached
- Improved input responsiveness while agent task lists update — task updates no longer re-render the entire UI
- Reduced per-tool-call CPU overhead in print/SDK sessions with many MCP tools by caching tool-pool assembly (up to 7x faster tool rounds at high tool counts)
- Reduced memory usage by bounding the file edit read cache to 16 MB instead of pinning up to 1,000 full files
- Reduced session transcript size (up to 79x in edit-heavy sessions) and bounded checkpoint disk usage by pruning superseded file-history backups
- Reduced memory usage when resuming sessions with background agents or forks spawned from large conversations
- Completed background agents now stay listed in `/tasks` until cleanup instead of vanishing the moment they finish
- Attaching to a stopped background agent now shows its transcript immediately while the session warms up, instead of a blank "Session is starting" screen
- Background sessions: an older daemon no longer silently restarts workers spawned by a newer version onto the older binary
- Agent view: Ctrl+X now deletes renamed-branch worktrees, never destroys unpushed commits, keeps the session row when a worktree is kept, and reused worktree names reset to the current base
- Catastrophic removals (e.g. `rm -rf ~`) in commands containing `$(…)`/backticks/`<(…)` now prompt in `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and auto mode, matching the plain form
- `/install-github-app` and the `/mcp` settings menu no longer open in background sessions
- MCP servers configured with an empty URL now show as "not configured" in `/mcp` instead of a config error
- `/usage` now shows your last-known usage bars with an "as of" note when the usage endpoint is rate-limited, instead of an error screen
- Fixed Bedrock auth failing with "Session token not found or invalid" for AWS SSO profiles whose sso_region differs from the Bedrock region (2.1.207 regression)

## 2.1.207

- Auto mode is now available without `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE` opt-in on Bedrock, Vertex AI, and Foundry; disable via `disableAutoMode` in settings
- Fixed the terminal freezing and keystrokes lagging while streaming responses containing very long lists, tables, paragraphs, or code blocks
- Fixed remote managed settings from a non-interactive run (`claude -p`, the SDK) being permanently recorded as consented without ever showing the security consent dialog
- Fixed spurious prompt-injection warnings triggered by benign system-generated conversation updates
- Fixed the auto-updater overwriting a custom launcher script or symlink at `~/.local/bin/claude` on every release; `/doctor` now reports an externally managed launcher
- Fixed compound commands with `cd` prompting for permission when the only output redirect was to `/dev/null`
- Fixed the transcript jumping above the start of the answer when a response finishes streaming
- Fixed `extensions.worktreeConfig` being left in the repo's `.git/config` (breaking go-git tools like `tea`) after the last `worktree.sparsePaths` worktree was removed
- Fixed malformed bracket patterns in rules globs, skill paths, `.ignore`, and `.worktreeinclude` breaking file reads, file suggestions, and worktree creation
- Fixed a crash loop in agent teams where a malformed teammate mailbox message caused repeated errors every second until the mailbox file was manually deleted
- Fixed background sessions auto-named by accepting a plan not showing that name on their agent-view row
- Fixed background sessions that entered a git worktree resuming blank after a cold reopen from the agent list
- Fixed Remote Control task status updates being lost when the connection recovered from a network interruption or credential refresh
- Fixed Remote Control sessions hosted by the desktop app not showing background agent and workflow progress on mobile and web
- Fixed Deep research runs labeling every Fetch-phase agent "unknown" — chips now show the source hostname
- Fixed Bedrock repeatedly requesting fresh AWS SSO credentials from IAM Identity Center on every API request
- Improved agent view: pasting the same text again now expands the collapsed `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder instead of adding a second one
- Improved agent view: blocked session peeks now lead with the question and show a worded staleness clock (`waiting 3m`) instead of the same timestamp twice
- Changed Bedrock, Vertex, and Claude Platform on AWS to default to Claude Opus 4.8
- Changed auto mode to no longer read `autoMode` from `.claude/settings.local.json` (repo-resident); use `~/.claude/settings.json` instead
- Fixed an indefinite hang on Windows when AWS credential resolution stalls (e.g. a stuck `credential_process`): the 60-second stall guard now fires instead of waiting forever.
- Plugin hooks/monitors/MCP headersHelper: `${user_config.*}` in shell-form commands is now rejected (shell-injection fix). Hooks: use exec form (`args` array) or `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>`; monitors and headersHelper: read the value inside the script (config file or the server's `env` block).
- Plugin option values (`pluginConfigs`) are no longer read from project-level `.claude/settings.json`; only user, `--settings`, and managed settings are honored
- Fixed `/usage-credits` amount inputs silently stripping malformed values (e.g. a pasted timestamp) to digits; malformed amounts are now rejected with an error, and amounts over $1,000 require a typed confirmation

## 2.1.206

- Added directory path suggestions to `/cd`, matching `/add-dir` behavior
- Added a `/doctor` check that proposes trimming checked-in `CLAUDE.md` files by cutting content Claude could derive from the codebase
- `/commit-push-pr` now auto-allows `git push` to the repo's configured push remote (`remote.pushDefault`, or the sole remote when only one is configured) in addition to `origin`
- Gateway: `/login` now supports Anthropic-operated public gateway endpoints
- `EnterWorktree` now asks for confirmation before entering a git worktree outside the project's `.claude/worktrees/` directory
- Background agents now upgrade to a new version in the background right after a Claude Code update, instead of paying a slow stale-session upgrade when you attach
- Fixed an expired login failing every model with a misleading "There's an issue with the selected model" error instead of prompting to run `/login`
- Fixed `claude --resume` and `--continue` not responding to keyboard input on startup
- Fixed MCP servers configured via `--mcp-config` or `.mcp.json` ignoring a per-server `request_timeout_ms`, which caused long-running MCP tool calls to time out at the 60s default in fresh sessions
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_EXTRA_BODY` being silently ignored by `claude agents` / `--bg` background workers; the shell-exported override now follows the dispatching session
- Fixed OAuth MCP servers requiring manual re-authentication after a single failed token refresh
- Fixed `--permission-prompt-tool` pointing at an MCP server crashing with "MCP tool not found" on cold start before the server finishes connecting
- Fixed `/model` picker rows printing a price for a different model than the row named, and stopped quoting first-party list prices on providers that don't bill them
- Fixed server-provided model rows being misplaced in the `/model` picker when an entitlement or allowlist restriction drops the row they were positioned against
- Fixed desktop sessions getting stuck showing "running" after a slash command was sent mid-turn
- Fixed keyboard input being ignored in the agents view when a setup prompt appeared before a bare `claude --resume` on Windows
- Fixed `claude rm` leaving the removed job in the daemon roster, causing the row to reappear in `claude agents`
- Fixed `/remote-control` showing "Unknown command" when logged out — it now explains how to sign in

- Fixed `/status` listing the same broken-install warning twice
- Fixed false "disused plugin" tips and skewed disuse telemetry for LSP plugins
- Fixed `/doctor`'s update check to compare Homebrew installs against their cask's channel instead of the settings channel
- Fixed the fullscreen jump-to-bottom pill suggesting Ctrl+End on macOS, not showing rebound chords, and wrapping over the transcript
- Bedrock: fixed a multi-minute startup hang when using an `awsCredentialExport` helper on networks with restricted egress
- Improved `/code-review` findings quality on claude-opus-4-8 across all effort levels
- Improved agents view: status column now uses full terminal width instead of truncating at 64 characters

## 2.1.205

- Added an auto mode rule that blocks tampering with session transcript files
- Fixed `--json-schema` silently producing unstructured output when the schema was invalid, and schemas using the `format` keyword being rejected

- Fixed session-to-PR linking missing a PR created in a Bash call whose output exceeded the 30K inline limit
- Fixed `claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop` getting stuck when a server name contains unsupported characters; invalid names are now reported and remaining servers still import
- Fixed a plugin LSP server that fails to initialize preventing a valid LSP server from another plugin handling the same file extension
- Fixed a Windows crash when the directory Claude was launched from is deleted, locked, or unmounted while a command is running

- Auto-update binary downloads now stream to disk instead of buffering in memory, cutting the updater's peak memory usage by roughly 400 MB
- Background task notifications now explicitly state that no human input has occurred, preventing fabricated in-transcript approvals from being acted on
- Improved agent view: sessions that edit, merge, comment on, or push to an existing PR now link it in `claude agents`
- Improved agent view: rows now show a colored state word and a classifier-written headline instead of raw tool call text, and the peek opens with full status including the exact ask for blocked sessions
- `/doctor` is now a full setup checkup that can diagnose and fix issues; `/checkup` is its alias
- Reserved the "Claude Browser" MCP server name (alongside "Claude Preview") ahead of the Claude Desktop pane rename; user-configured MCP servers can no longer register under either name
- Fixed Cowork VM-mode local-agent sessions failing to start with "Not logged in · Please run /login" on CLI 2.1.203+

## 2.1.204

- Fixed hook events not streaming during SessionStart hooks in headless sessions, which could cause remote workers to be idle-reaped mid-hook

## 2.1.203

- Added a warning when your login is about to expire, so you can re-authenticate before background sessions are interrupted
- Added a grey ⏸ badge to the footer when in manual permission mode, making the active mode always visible
- Added the session's additional working directories to MCP `roots/list`, with `notifications/roots/list_changed` sent when the set changes
- Fixed opening or switching background agent sessions on macOS stalling for 15–20 seconds due to a false low-memory detection (regression in 2.1.196)
- Fixed background sessions becoming permanently unresponsive to attach, replies, and stop when the daemon's session token went stale — the session now recovers automatically
- Fixed returning to `claude agents` silently stopping running subagents and re-running the prompt from scratch — their work now carries over
- Fixed a memory and per-turn CPU regression in interactive sessions: the context-usage indicator no longer re-analyzes the entire transcript after every turn
- Fixed background agents inheriting a stale `PATH` from the daemon instead of the dispatching shell, causing missing tools on Windows
- Fixed background and agent-view sessions dropping a shell-exported `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, which sent API keys to the default endpoint and failed with 401
- Fixed Bash failing with "argument list too long" in repos with many git worktrees
- Fixed worktree-isolated subagents sometimes running shell commands in the parent checkout instead of their own worktree
- Fixed worktree creation rejecting nested repositories in multi-repo workspaces, leaving background sessions unable to isolate and edit

- Fixed a background daemon auto-upgrade failure silently killing all running background sessions
- Fixed `TaskStop` and `TaskOutput` failing to find background agents spawned by another agent — errors now list running agents by id and description
- Fixed the `claude agents` composer discarding your typed message when a slash command isn't available there
- Fixed the agent list crashing when opening a stopped session whose conversation was already open in another session
- Fixed background sessions showing "Needs input" in the agent list after the question was already answered

- Fixed literal `^[[I` / `^[[O` escape codes being printed when reattaching to a background session
- Fixed LSP-only plugins being incorrectly flagged for disuse when their language servers deliver diagnostics or answer navigation requests
- Improved responsiveness while long responses stream: live-preview updates no longer re-render the whole screen
- Improved subagent behavior: agents are now less likely to re-delegate their entire task to another subagent
- Reduced binary size by ~7 MB and startup memory by ~7 MB by loading a large bundled dependency lazily instead of inlining it
- Changed left arrow to no longer close the background tasks, diff, and workflow detail views — press Esc instead
- Changed the empty `claude agents` view to always show the organized sections (Needs input / Working / Completed) with descriptions
- Removed the startup "claude command missing or broken" warnings — they now appear in `/doctor` and `/status` instead
- Removed a redundant navigation hint from the `claude agents` footer
- [VSCode] Added a Settings toggle for "Enable Remote Control for all sessions"

## 2.1.202

- Added a "Dynamic workflow size" setting in `/config` for controlling how large Claude generally makes dynamic workflows (small/medium/large agent counts) — an advisory guideline, not an enforced cap
- Added `workflow.run_id` and `workflow.name` OpenTelemetry attributes to telemetry emitted by workflow-spawned agents, so a workflow run's activity can be reconstructed from OTel data
- Fixed a crash in the inline Ctrl+R history search when accepting or cancelling while the search was still scanning the history file
- Fixed `/rename` on background sessions being reverted when the job restarts, which broke addressing the session by its new name

- Fixed images and files sent from the Remote Control mobile or web app without a caption being silently dropped
- Fixed the sign-in URL printed by `claude auth login` and `claude mcp login --no-browser` not being reliably clickable when it wraps over SSH — it is now emitted as a single hyperlink
- Fixed opening a chat from `claude agents` sometimes failing with "currently running as a background agent" followed by a worker crash/respawn loop
- Fixed workflow scripts with unicode quote escapes in strings being corrupted before parsing; workflow parse errors now show the offending line instead of always blaming TypeScript
- Fixed voice dictation retrying in an unbounded loop when the microphone or audio recorder fails — repeated capture failures now pause voice input
- Fixed `/remote-control` sessions showing the wrong permission mode in the mobile and web apps
- Fixed resuming a session by name, or opening the resume picker, taking minutes and using a large amount of memory in repositories with many git worktrees
- Fixed installer and updater downloads failing immediately with "aborted" when a proxy or network drops the connection mid-download — transient connection drops now retry
- Fixed re-invoking an already-loaded skill appending a duplicate copy of its instructions to context
- Improved `/workflows` agent list layout: wider titles, a dedicated time column, shorter model names, and no per-row tool-call counts
- Improved MCP error messages: clearer error when a server config has `url` but no `type`, suggesting `"type": "http"` instead of the misleading "command: expected string"
- Changed `/review <pr>` back to a fast single-pass review; use `/code-review <level> <pr#>` for the multi-agent review at a chosen effort level

## 2.1.201

- Claude Sonnet 5 sessions no longer use the mid-conversation system role for harness reminders

## 2.1.200

- Changed `AskUserQuestion` dialogs to no longer auto-continue by default; opt into an idle timeout via `/config`
- Changed the "default" permission mode to "Manual" across the CLI, `--help`, VS Code, and JetBrains; `--permission-mode manual` and `"defaultMode": "manual"` are accepted alongside `default`
- Fixed a crash at startup when `disabledMcpServers` or `enabledMcpServers` in `.claude.json` is set to a non-array value
- Fixed background sessions silently stopping mid-turn after sleep/wake or when reopening a stalled session
- Fixed background sessions re-running a turn cancelled with Esc after a stall respawn
- Fixed background agents never starting again after a crash left a stale `daemon.lock` whose PID the OS reused
- Fixed background-agent daemon handover so a reinstalled older build can no longer take over the daemon; build recency is now judged by the version's embedded build timestamp
- Fixed background-agent roster issues: transient corruption permanently disabling orphan cleanup, older binaries not preserving fields written by newer versions, and socket auth tokens being stripped during daemon restarts
- Fixed subagents cut off by a rate limit before producing any text output returning an empty result instead of failing cleanly
- Fixed control bytes from background-agent output reaching the terminal in the agent view
- Fixed `claude agents --plugin-dir <dir>` not showing the plugin's agents and skills in the agent view when the flag is placed after `agents`

- Fixed `/mcp` server list not tracking focus for screen readers and magnifiers
- Fixed voice dictation showing a misleading "Voice connection failed" message when a recording captures no audio
- Fixed rendering flicker under tmux 3.4+ by enabling synchronized terminal output
- Improved screen-reader output: decorative glyphs are now hidden, transcript symbols read as short labels, and nested tables read as `Header: value.` lines
- Improved the install script to explain when installation is killed by the system running out of memory

## 2.1.199

- Stacked slash-skill invocations like `/skill-a /skill-b do XYZ` now load all leading skills (up to 5), not just the first
- Fixed SSL certificate errors (TLS-inspecting proxies, missing `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, expired certs) burning retries before showing actionable guidance — they now fail immediately with the fix hint
- Fixed streaming responses being discarded when the API emits a mid-stream overloaded/server error after partial output — the partial is now kept with an incomplete-response notice
- Fixed subagents cut off by a rate limit or server error silently failing instead of returning their partial work to the parent
- Fixed subagents reporting API errors (e.g. usage limit reached) as successful results — the error is now reported to the parent agent
- Fixed the background-agent daemon on Linux killing itself and every running agent every ~50 seconds after an unclean shutdown left a corrupted worker record
- Fixed background agents failing to cold-start over SSH on macOS with "Could not switch to audit session" (regression in 2.1.196)
- Fixed `claude stop` being silently undone when it raced a background-agent respawn — the respawn now honors the stop
- Fixed background job progress indicators stalling for minutes while the job ran long commands
- Fixed background sessions on memory-starved machines showing a generic error — they now indicate low memory and suggest freeing resources
- Fixed remote sessions briefly flapping between Working and Idle in the agent view when a background agent completes
- Fixed idle subagents vanishing from the agent panel while other subagents were still working; surplus idle agents now collapse into an expandable summary row
- Fixed typing `/model` or `/fast` while viewing a subagent silently opening the lead's model picker — a notice now explains the command applies to the lead
- Fixed `SessionStart`, `Setup`, and `SubagentStart` hooks silently hiding stderr when exiting with code 2 — the error is now shown in the transcript
- Fixed `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions daemon <subcommand>` being treated as a chat prompt instead of running the subcommand
- Fixed `SendMessage` silently misrouting when a re-spawned agent reuses a previous agent's name — the tool now detects the mismatch and asks the caller to retarget
- Fixed opening or resuming a session with no new messages needlessly growing the transcript file
- Fixed backgrounding a session with `←` or `/background` dropping its `/color` from the agent view row
- Fixed resetting a corrupted config file from the startup recovery dialog destroying it unrecoverably — it now backs up the file first
- Fixed Claude in Chrome repeatedly opening the reconnect page when sessions run from different builds or config directories
- Fixed plan mode not prompting for state-changing browser tool calls; read-only `browser_batch` calls are now correctly auto-allowed
- Transient server rate-limit errors (429s unrelated to your usage limit) are now retried automatically with backoff for subscribers instead of failing the turn
- `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG` now raises the default retry count for non-capacity transient errors to 300 and lifts the cap of 15 on `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES`
- `claude agents` session rows now show pull-request links as bare `#N` without the redundant "PR" label

## 2.1.198

- Subagents now run in the background by default, so Claude keeps working while they run and is notified when they finish (previously a gradual rollout)
- Claude in Chrome is now generally available
- Added background agent notifications in `claude agents` — sessions that need input or finish now fire the `Notification` hook (`agent_needs_input` / `agent_completed`)
- Added `/dataviz` skill for chart and dashboard design guidance with a runnable color-palette validator
- Gateway: added Claude Platform on AWS (anthropicAws) as an upstream provider; model-not-found responses now advance the failover chain
- Background agents launched from `claude agents` now commit, push, and open a draft PR when they finish code work in a worktree, instead of stopping to ask
- The built-in Explore agent now inherits the main session's model (capped at opus) instead of running on haiku
- Subagents and context compaction now inherit the session's extended thinking configuration, improving output quality on delegated tasks
- Fixed brief network drops mid-response aborting the turn — transient errors like ECONNRESET now retry with backoff instead of failing
- Fixed excessive background classifier requests when sandboxed processes repeatedly accessed the same network host
- Fixed background tasks in web, desktop, and VS Code task panels getting stuck on "Running" after they finish or after resuming a session
- Fixed agent teams: a teammate that dies on an API error now reports "failed" to the lead, and messaging a stuck teammate wakes it to retry immediately
- Fixed the `/diff` panel not refreshing when you switch branches or commit outside the session
- Fixed markdown tables overflowing and wrapping their right border when rendered in fullscreen mode
- Fixed Claude Platform on AWS and Mantle sessions dead-ending with "Please run /login" when the STS token expires — `awsAuthRefresh` now runs automatically
- Fixed "no route to host" for local-network hosts in macOS background agent sessions by declaring Local Network entitlements
- Fixed `/desktop` failing with "Cannot determine working directory" after entering and exiting a worktree
- Fixed background agents repeatedly showing "Reconnecting…" every ~52 seconds on macOS while the agents view was open
- Fixed pressing `←` inside `claude attach <id>` exiting to the shell instead of opening the agent view
- Fixed `claude --bg` silently creating an unattachable session when combined with `--print`/`-p`; the conflicting flags are now rejected up front

- Fixed double-click word selection in fullscreen mode to select the entire URL including the scheme
- Fixed plan mode not auto-allowing read-only tool calls when a session starts in plan mode
- Fixed `/branch` deriving its default fork name from the compaction summary instead of the first real prompt
- Improved focus mode: subagents launched in a turn now appear in its activity summary, and completed background notifications fold into a single count
- Improved syntax highlighting accuracy in code blocks, diffs, and file previews by upgrading to highlight.js 11
- Keyboard shortcut hints now show opt/cmd instead of alt/super when connected from a Mac over SSH
- Improved API retry UX: the error reason is now shown after the second attempt, and a status page link replaces the spinner tip when the API is overloaded
- `/login` now opens the sign-in dialog from the `claude agents` view instead of saying it isn't available
- Subagents now treat messages from the agent that launched them as normal task direction; an agent's message is still never treated as the user's approval
- Removed the `/agents` wizard; ask Claude to create or manage subagents, or edit `.claude/agents/` directly

## 2.1.197

- Introducing Claude Sonnet 5: now the default model in Claude Code, with a native 1M-token context window and promotional pricing of $2/$10 per Mtok through August 31. Update to version 2.1.197 for access. https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-5

## 2.1.196

- Added support for organization default models — admins set it in the org console; it shows as "Org default" (or "Role default") in `/model` when you haven't picked one yourself
- Added readable default names for sessions at start, making them easier to identify and message
- Added clickable file attachments in chat — Cmd/Ctrl-click reveals the file in Finder/Explorer
- Security: `claude mcp list`/`get` no longer spawn `.mcp.json` servers that a repo self-approved via a committed `.claude/settings.json`; untrusted workspaces show `⏸ Pending approval`
- Fixed waking a background job permanently deleting its conversation and re-running the original prompt when the transcript probe misread a real transcript; the file is now set aside, never deleted
- Fixed the rate-limit warning flickering off and rate-limit telemetry being over-counted when multiple parallel requests were in flight at the moment a usage limit was hit
- Fixed duplicate recap lines after a background session's turn: a schema-rejected StructuredOutput attempt no longer renders alongside its retry
- Fixed PowerShell `git diff`/`git grep`, `egrep`/`fgrep`, and quoted search patterns containing `|` being reported as failures when they exit 1, matching Bash behavior
- Fixed multiple `claude agents` side panel issues: keyboard focus getting stuck when opening an agent, background jobs losing their subagent types on every open, and sessions showing incorrect status while actively running
- Fixed `claude agents --dangerously-skip-permissions` silently falling back to auto mode instead of showing the bypass disclaimer and applying bypass mode to spawned agents
- Fixed mid-turn crash recovery for Remote sessions — sessions interrupted by a server restart now auto-resume on the next worker
- Fixed sessions moved with `/cd` reappearing in the old directory's resume list after a non-graceful exit when the old path contained special characters
- Fixed `claude plugin validate` skipping local plugins whose source is "." and stopping after the first error class
- Fixed Esc Esc at an idle prompt not opening the rewind menu (regression); use Ctrl+C or Ctrl+X Ctrl+K to stop background agents
- Fixed MCP OAuth requesting the authorization server's full `scopes_supported` catalog when no scope is specified, causing `invalid_scope` failures on GitLab self-hosted and other enterprise IdPs
- Fixed `/context` showing 0 tokens for all tool groups on Bedrock
- Fixed `/deep-research` misreporting verifier failures as "all claims refuted" instead of `unverified`
- Fixed plugin dependency version pins not being honored when the marketplace was added as a local folder path backed by a git repo
- Fixed `claude agents` session status: completed rows no longer flip between "Done" and "Needs your input", stalled agents are now labeled "Needs attention", and results that mention a PR show a clickable link
- Fixed voice dictation swallowing spaces and spuriously starting a recording during very fast typing when voice mode is enabled
- Improved background session reliability: long-running commands and workflows now survive the session's process being stopped, restarted, or updated — including on Windows, where background shells are handed off instead of being killed
- Improved background agents: workers killed by a daemon restart are now automatically resumed from where they left off the next time the agents view opens
- Improved `/code-review` workflow: merged five cleanup finders into one, cutting token usage by roughly 25%
- Reduced per-frame rendering work in the terminal UI by skipping no-op subtree walks during streaming
- The streaming idle watchdog is now on by default for all providers — it aborts and retries when a response stream produces no events for 5 minutes. Set `CLAUDE_ENABLE_STREAM_WATCHDOG=0` to disable.
- Remote Control is now disabled when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at a non-Anthropic host, matching the existing behavior under `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`/`_VERTEX`/`_FOUNDRY`
- Changed opening the agents view from a foreground session to require a single `←` press instead of two, matching the behavior in background sessions

## 2.1.195

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MOUSE_CLICKS` to disable mouse click/drag/hover in fullscreen mode while keeping wheel scroll
- Fixed hook matchers with hyphenated identifiers (e.g. `code-reviewer`, `mcp__brave-search`) accidentally substring-matching — they now exact-match. Use `mcp__brave-search__.*` to match all tools from a hyphenated MCP server.
- Fixed voice dictation on macOS capturing silence in long-running sessions after the default input device changes
- Fixed voice dictation auto-submit never firing for languages written without spaces (Japanese, Chinese, Thai)
- Fixed external plugins enabled only by project `.claude/settings.json` not requiring explicit install consent on every loader path

- Fixed background jobs disappearing from `claude agents` or losing data when written by a newer Claude Code version
- Fixed reopening a crashed background task showing a blank screen for up to 5 seconds instead of its restart
- Fixed background agent daemons running unreachable when the control socket fails to start, blocking restarts
- Improved voice mode on Linux: now distinguishes "no microphone" from "SoX not installed" when SoX is present but no audio capture device exists
- Improved `claude agents` completed list to fill available vertical space; on short terminals the header compacts so live sessions stay visible
- Improved Remote session startup with a provisioning checklist while the container starts

## 2.1.193

- Added `autoMode.classifyAllShell` setting to route all Bash/PowerShell commands through the auto-mode classifier instead of only arbitrary-code-execution patterns
- Added auto-mode denial reasons to the transcript, the denial toast, and `/permissions` recent denials
- Added `claude_code.assistant_response` OpenTelemetry log event containing the model's response text. Redacted unless `OTEL_LOG_ASSISTANT_RESPONSES=1`; when that var is unset it follows `OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS`, so deployments that already log prompt content will start receiving response content on upgrade — set `OTEL_LOG_ASSISTANT_RESPONSES=0` to keep prompts-only.
- Added live file path autocomplete to bash mode (`!`)
- Added a startup notice when MCP servers need authentication, pointing at `/mcp`
- Added automatic memory-pressure reaping for idle background shell commands (disable with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BG_SHELL_PRESSURE_REAP=1`)
- Fixed `/model` and other client-data-gated UI showing stale/empty state immediately after `/login`
- Fixed backgrounding (←←) spuriously cancelling with "N background tasks would be abandoned" when all running tasks carry over to the new session
- Fixed pinned background agents being re-prompted to "Continue from where you left off" after every auto-update
- Fixed backgrounding the main turn spawning a phantom "general-purpose (resumed)" subagent that re-ran the main conversation
- Fixed agent panel hiding sibling agents when viewing a subagent
- Improved background agents: the launch result no longer instructs Claude to "end your response" — it keeps working on other tasks while the agent runs
- Improved MCP `headersHelper` auth: the helper now re-runs and reconnects automatically when a tool call returns 401/403
- Improved plugin auto-rename: marketplace `renames` maps are now followed automatically, updating your settings to the new name
- Improved `/add-dir` message when the directory is already a working directory

## 2.1.191

- Added `/rewind` support for resuming a conversation from before `/clear` was run
- Fixed scroll position jumping to the bottom while reading earlier output during a streaming response
- Fixed background agents resurrecting after being stopped — stopping an agent from the tasks panel is now permanent

- Fixed `/login` URL opening truncated in Windows Terminal when it wraps across lines
- Fixed Cmd+click on links in fullscreen mode for Ghostty over ssh/tmux
- Fixed `claude agents` sending builtin slash commands like `/usage` to background sessions as prompt text instead of showing a hint
- Fixed `claude agents` job rows showing full filesystem paths for pasted images instead of the `[Image #N]` placeholder
- Fixed hooks with comma-separated matchers (e.g. `"Bash,PowerShell"`) silently never firing
- Fixed `/permissions` Recently-denied tab: approving a denial now persists on close instead of being silently discarded
- Fixed the agent panel jumping by one row when scrolling the roster past the overflow cap
- Fixed the welcome splash art overflowing the default 80×24 macOS Terminal window
- Fixed managed settings: `forceRemoteSettingsRefresh` now takes effect when set via MDM or file policy, and the fetch sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` to prevent proxies from serving stale responses
- Improved sandbox network permission dialog: hosts you allow with "Yes" are now remembered for the rest of the session instead of re-prompting on every connection
- Improved MCP server reliability: capability discovery (`tools/list`, `prompts/list`, `resources/list`) now retries transient network errors with short backoff
- Improved MCP OAuth: discovery and token requests now retry once after transient network errors, and headless environments skip the browser popup and go straight to the paste-the-URL prompt
- Improved MCP error messages: HTTP 404 errors now show the URL and point to your MCP config
- Improved vim mode prompt-history search (NORMAL `/`) to hint how to reach slash commands
- Reduced CPU usage during streaming responses by ~37% by coalescing text updates to 100ms
- Reduced long-session memory growth from terminal output cache

## 2.1.190

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.187

- Added `sandbox.credentials` setting to block sandboxed commands from reading credential files and secret environment variables

- Fixed `--resume` failing with "No conversation found" when the original `-p` run produced no model turns
- Fixed `--json-schema` and workflow `agent({schema})` structured output: the model can no longer re-call `StructuredOutput` indefinitely after a successful call, and follow-up turns now reliably return structured output
- Fixed remote MCP tool calls that hang with no response for 5 minutes — they now abort with an error instead of blocking indefinitely (override with `CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_TOOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT`)
- Fixed Claude Code Remote sessions taking ~2.7s longer to start after the agent proxy CA system-trust install was added
- Fixed pasted Korean/CJK text turning into mojibake in terminals that deliver paste as per-byte extended-key events

- Fixed agent stop notifications not correctly attributing who stopped the agent, and improved wording ("finished"/"stopped" instead of "came to rest")
- Fixed subagent depth tracking: resumed subagents now restore their original spawn depth, and forked subagents now count toward the depth cap
- Fixed leaked agent worktree registrations: locked `.git/worktrees/` entries from killed agents are now cleaned up automatically
- Fixed Cmd+click not opening URLs in fullscreen mode in Ghostty on macOS
- Fixed `claude --help` not listing the `--bg`/`--background` flag
- Fixed Esc, Ctrl-C, and Ctrl-D not working while `/share` is uploading
- Improved `/install-github-app`: GitHub Actions workflow setup is now optional — you can install just the GitHub App and skip the workflow/secret steps
- Improved `/btw` with ←/→ arrow navigation to step through earlier answers
- Improved `/plugin` to surface plugins you haven't used recently so you can clean them up
- [VSCode] Fixed extension becoming unresponsive when resuming a large session

- Fixed background job status in `claude agents` showing a stale "needs input" message after replying
- Fixed a dark-theme flash when opening a background session from `claude agents` on a light terminal
- Fixed mouse-selected text staying highlighted after deleting it in `claude agents`
- Fixed session cost not showing for usage-based Enterprise and Team subscribers

- Fixed Workflow `agent({schema})` subagents looping forever on repeated schema validation failures instead of aborting after 5 attempts
- Improved `claude mcp get` and `claude mcp remove` to suggest the closest configured server name on a typo and truncate long server lists
- Improved memory: the agent is now reminded to compact its `MEMORY.md` index when nearing the size limit
- Improved skill frontmatter: `display-name`, `default-enabled`, `fallback`, and `metadata.*` keys now accept kebab-case, snake_case, and camelCase
- Improved malformed `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter handling: loads the skill body with empty metadata instead of failing silently
- Changed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES` to cap at 15; for unattended sessions, use `CLAUDE_CODE_RETRY_WATCHDOG` instead
- Changed background subagents to surface permission prompts in the main session instead of auto-denying; the dialog shows which agent is asking, and Esc denies just that tool
- Changed `/review <pr>` to use the same review engine as `/code-review medium`

## 2.1.185

- The stream-stall hint now reads "Waiting for API response · will retry in …" instead of "No response from API · Retrying in …", and triggers after 20s of silence instead of 10s

## 2.1.183

- Improved auto mode safety: destructive git commands (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash drop`) are now blocked when you didn't ask to discard local work, `git commit --amend` is blocked when the commit wasn't made by the agent this session, and `terraform destroy`/`pulumi destroy`/`cdk destroy` are blocked unless you asked for the specific stack
- Added a warning when the requested model is deprecated or automatically updated to a newer model, shown on stderr in print mode (`-p`) and now also covering models set in agent frontmatter
- Added `attribution.sessionUrl` setting to omit the claude.ai session link from commits and PRs in web and Remote Control sessions
- Added `/config --help` to list all available shorthand keys for `/config key=value`
- Changed `/config` toggle behavior: Enter and Space both change the selected setting, and Esc now saves and closes instead of reverting
- Removed the startup "setup issues" line under the logo — run `/doctor` to see configuration issues or use `--debug`
- Fixed `thinking.disabled.display: Extra inputs are not permitted` 400 errors on subagent spawns and session-title generation for affected configurations
- Fixed WebSearch returning empty results in subagents
- Fixed the terminal cursor being stranded above the prompt after navigating history in vim mode with the native cursor enabled
- Fixed fullscreen TUI corruption (statusline mid-screen, duplicated spinner rows, merged text) in Windows Terminal under heavy nested-subagent load
- Fixed turns silently completing with no visible output when the model returned only a thinking block; Claude now re-prompts once
- Fixed user-level skills appearing multiple times in slash-command autocomplete when multiple plugins are enabled
- Fixed MCP servers requiring authentication exposing auth-stub tools to the model in headless/SDK mode
- Fixed tmux teammate panes failing to launch when the shell has slow rc-file initialization, and keystrokes typed during agent spawn leaking into the new tmux pane instead of the leader prompt
- Fixed background tasks started by a teammate being killed when the teammate finishes a turn
- Fixed scheduled task and webhook trigger deliveries being treated as keyboard input; they now classify as task notifications and can no longer approve a pending action or set the session title in auto mode
- Fixed focus mode showing "Ran N PostToolUse hooks" timing lines under each response

## 2.1.181

- Added `/config key=value` syntax to set any setting from the prompt (e.g. `/config thinking=false`) — works in interactive, `-p`, and Remote Control
- Added `sandbox.allowAppleEvents` opt-in setting that lets sandboxed commands send Apple Events on macOS
- Added `CLAUDE_CLIENT_PRESENCE_FILE` environment variable: point it at a marker file to suppress mobile push notifications while you're at the machine
- Upgraded the bundled Bun runtime to 1.4
- Improved streaming of long paragraphs: text now appears line-by-line instead of waiting for the first line break
- Improved auto-retry: API connection drops mid-thinking now automatically retry instead of showing "Connection closed while thinking"
- Improved the subagent panel: idle subagents auto-hide after 30s, the list caps at 5 rows with scroll hints, and keyboard hints now show in the footer
- Improved the MCP OAuth browser page to match Claude Code's visual style and auto-close on success
- Changed fullscreen mode URL opening to require Cmd+click (macOS) / Ctrl+click, matching native terminal behavior
- Changed the `Improved N memories` line to no longer list individual files outside verbose mode
- Fixed prompt caching not reading on custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and on Foundry due to a per-request attestation token changing every turn
- Fixed Write/Edit producing 0-byte or truncated files on network drives and cloud-synced folders
- Fixed `open`, `osascript`, and browser-based auth flows failing with error -600 on macOS by adding the Apple Events entitlement
- Fixed a startup regression (~120ms per launch in fresh environments, introduced in 2.1.169): the first prompt no longer waits for the managed-settings fetch when no MCP servers are configured
- Fixed startup blocking with a blank terminal for up to 15 seconds when the account settings fetch is slow on a degraded network
- Fixed startup crash (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`) when `.claude.json` contains corrupted null project entries
- Fixed macOS TUI freezing at session start (Ctrl+C unresponsive) when Spotlight is busy reindexing
- Fixed long-running idle sessions losing their history when another Claude Code process ran the 30-day transcript cleanup
- Fixed foreground subagents spawning unbounded nested chains; they now respect the same 5-level depth limit as background subagents
- Fixed `/recap` and conversation forks using the previous model immediately after a model switch
- Fixed subagent "Thinking" duration showing the parent agent's elapsed time instead of the subagent's own
- Fixed subagents blocked on a nested agent showing a ticking elapsed time instead of "waiting" in the agent panel
- Fixed the API retry indicator ("Retrying in 0s · attempt N/10") staying on screen after the retry succeeded
- Fixed AWS `awsCredentialExport` credentials with a short remaining lifetime causing credential refreshes every minute, and now accepts the JSON shape from `aws configure export-credentials`
- Fixed `claude mcp get`/`list` showing `✓ Connected` when tools/list fails; they now show `! Connected · tools fetch failed` with the error detail
- Fixed `/remote-control` leaving a stale "connecting…" line; it now confirms in the transcript once connected
- Fixed ExitWorktree refusing to remove a clean worktree with "Could not verify worktree state" when bare `git` cannot be resolved on Windows
- Fixed settings changes (such as `/effort` or `/model`) failing with ENOENT when `~/.claude/settings.json` is a relative symlink under a symlinked `~/.claude`
- Fixed IDE selection line numbers in context reminders being off by one (IntelliJ and VS Code)
- Fixed Ctrl+C in fullscreen after a native terminal selection (modifier+drag) overwriting the clipboard with the app's prior selection
- Fixed Ctrl+V showing "No image found in clipboard" instead of pasting when the clipboard contains text
- Fixed agent creation failing with "EEXIST: file already exists" when the agents directory already exists (Windows/OneDrive)
- Fixed AskUserQuestion preview content being cut off at the dialog edge instead of word-wrapping
- Fixed AskUserQuestion multi-select questions silently dropping a typed "Other" free-text answer when submitting
- Fixed `/stats` "Most active day" and daily token chart dates showing one day early in UTC-negative timezones
- Fixed `/copy` and copy-on-select on Linux not detecting a clipboard utility installed after Claude Code started
- Fixed tab-indented code rendering with incorrect indentation in the Write (create-file) preview
- Fixed user prompts queued mid-turn not showing a full-width background highlight in the transcript
- Fixed the activity spinner's pulse dwelling on the wrong glyph size in Ghostty

## 2.1.179

- Fixed mid-stream connection drops: partial responses are now preserved instead of showing a raw error, and the spinner no longer gets stuck at "running tool"
- Fixed mouse-wheel scrolling in WSL2 under Windows Terminal and VS Code (regression in 2.1.172)
- Fixed a sandbox `denyRead`/`allowRead` glob over a large directory tree making the Bash tool description enormous and the session unusable on Linux
- Fixed the feedback survey capturing a single-digit reply as a session rating immediately after a turn completes
- Fixed the welcome screen stacking multiple promotional banners — at most one promo now shows per session
- Fixed Ctrl+O not showing the subagent's transcript when viewing a subagent
- Fixed clicking the prompt input not returning focus from the subagent/footer panel
- Fixed remote session background tasks appearing stuck as "still running" between turns
- Improved plugin loading performance in remote sessions

## 2.1.178

- Agent teams: removed the `TeamCreate` and `TeamDelete` tools. With `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` set, every session now has one implicit team — spawn teammates directly with the Agent tool's `name` parameter, no setup step needed. The `team_name` parameter on the Agent tool is still accepted but ignored.
- Added `Tool(param:value)` syntax for permission rules to match a tool's input parameters (with `*` wildcard), e.g. `Agent(model:opus)` to block Opus subagents
- Skills in nested `.claude/skills` directories now load when working on files there; on a name clash, the nested skill appears as `<dir>:<name>` so both stay available
- Nested `.claude/` directories: the agent, workflow, and output-style closest to the working directory now wins when names collide; project-scope workflow saves now target the closest existing `.claude/workflows/`
- Improved auto mode: subagent spawns are now evaluated by the classifier before launch, closing a gap where a subagent could request a blocked action without review
- Improved `/doctor` with consistent flat tree layout across all sections, clearer section status icons, and highlighted command names
- Improved the skill listing truncation warning to show how many skill descriptions are affected
- Changed the workflow prompt keyword to use a purple shimmer highlight and trigger only on explicit phrases like "run a workflow" or "workflow:", not on any mention of the word
- Improved Remote Control error messages: connection failures now show a persistent red "/rc failed" indicator in the footer, and the "not yet enabled" error now explains whether it's a gate, a check failure, stale entitlement, or org policy
- `/bug` now requires a description before submitting, and no longer uses model-refusal text as the GitHub issue title
- Fixed a crash (out-of-memory) when the CLI inherits a stale websocket/OAuth file-descriptor environment variable from a parent process
- Fixed Claude in Chrome silently failing to connect when the OAuth token belongs to a different account than the Claude Code login
- Fixed nested `.claude/skills` skills with directory-qualified names being blocked by permission prompts in non-interactive runs
- Fixed several subagent issues: viewing a subagent's transcript now shows tool results and live progress, messages sent while it finishes its turn are no longer dropped, and backgrounding a running subagent (ctrl+b) no longer restarts it from scratch
- Fixed `claude agents` workers failing with `401 Invalid bearer token` when the daemon was started from a shell with a custom API gateway via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Fixed compaction not honoring `--fallback-model`: compaction now falls back to the configured fallback model chain on overload or model-availability errors
- Fixed model requests continuing to fail with auth errors after credentials were refreshed outside the session, due to a stale cached request configuration
- Fixed background sessions created with `/bg` or `←←` after a turn finished showing "Working" forever in the agents list
- Fixed Linux sandbox failing to start when `.claude/skills` or `.claude/hooks` is a symlink
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_KEEP_MARKETPLACE_ON_FAILURE=1` preventing fresh marketplace installs from cloning
- Fixed MCP server-level specs (`mcp__server`, `mcp__server__*`, `mcp__*`) in subagent `disallowedTools` being silently ignored
- Fixed vim mode undo: `u` now steps through NORMAL/VISUAL-mode commands one at a time instead of merging commands in quick succession into a single undo step
- Fixed statusline links with custom URI schemes (e.g. `vscode://`) not opening when clicked in `claude agents`
- [VSCode] Fixed pressing Esc to dismiss a CJK IME candidate window canceling the running Claude task

## 2.1.176

- Session titles are now generated in the language of your conversation (set the `language` setting to pin a specific language)
- Added `footerLinksRegexes` setting for regex-matched link badges in the footer row, configurable via user or managed settings
- Improved Bedrock credential caching: credentials from `awsCredentialExport` are now cached until their `Expiration` instead of a fixed 1 hour
- Fixed `availableModels` enforcement: alias model picks can no longer be redirected to a blocked model via `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` environment variables, and `/fast` now refuses to toggle when it would switch to a model outside the allowlist
- Fixed auto mode failing on Fable 5 for organizations without Opus 4.8 enabled — the classifier now falls back to the best available Opus model
- Fixed hook `if` conditions for Read/Edit/Write tool paths: documented patterns like `Edit(src/**)`, `Read(~/.ssh/**)`, and `Read(.env)` now match correctly
- Fixed Linux sandbox failing to start when `.claude/settings.json` is a symlink with an absolute target
- Fixed `/copy` and mouse-selection copy not reaching the system clipboard inside tmux over SSH, and tmux paste buffer not loading on versions older than 3.2
- Fixed Remote Control connecting from web/mobile silently switching the session's model
- Fixed Remote Control disconnect notifications showing a bare numeric code instead of a human-readable reason, and connection failures adding a duplicate line to the conversation transcript
- Fixed Remote Control sessions not disconnecting when you sign in to a different account
- Fixed `/cd` and worktree moves leaving the session reporting the previous directory's git branch
- Fixed `claude agents`: pressing back in one window no longer detaches other windows attached to the same session
- Fixed backgrounded sessions showing "Working" forever when `/bg` mid-turn had nothing left to continue
- Fixed background agent search by PR URL: PRs opened during scheduled wakeups or while a job was blocked now appear in `claude agents` search
- Fixed the agents view input showing no text cursor on Windows
- Fixed `claude --bg -cn <name>` not seeding the session name
- Fixed background sessions to neutralize Windows network paths in persisted state before respawn
- Fixed background-session respawn rejecting malformed resume IDs from corrupted state files
- Fixed the Windows background-service daemon not starting when `~/.claude/daemon` has the ReadOnly attribute set
- Fixed cloud sessions failing with "Could not resolve authentication method" when idle for too long before being claimed
- Background sessions now show clearer guidance when a window left open across an auto-update can't submit a reply, and `claude daemon status` explains version-skew behavior

## 2.1.175

- Added `enforceAvailableModels` managed setting — when enabled, the `availableModels` allowlist also constrains the Default model (a Default that would resolve to a disallowed model now falls back to the first allowed model), and user or project settings can no longer widen a managed `availableModels` list

## 2.1.174

- Added `wheelScrollAccelerationEnabled` setting to disable mouse-wheel scroll acceleration in fullscreen mode
- Fixed the `/model` picker hiding the model family that Default resolves to — Opus now appears as its own row on Max/Team Premium/Enterprise plans, Sonnet on Pro/Team plans, and Opus on pay-as-you-go API accounts
- Fixed `/model` picker showing a hardcoded Sonnet version label when `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` pins a different Sonnet
- Fixed the "Fable 5 is now consuming usage credits" banner incorrectly showing for enterprise accounts with usage-based billing
- Fixed Bedrock GovCloud regions (`us-gov-*`) deriving the wrong inference profile prefix (`global` instead of `us-gov`), causing 400 errors on derived model IDs
- Fixed background sessions inheriting another session's `ANTHROPIC_*` provider env (gateway URL, custom headers, `/model` aliases) from the shell that started the background daemon
- Fixed a 1-2 second pause when exiting Claude Code shortly after a shell command was interrupted or killed on macOS and Linux
- Fixed git commit co-author attribution showing an incorrect model name for some models
- Fixed the `/advisor` dialog pre-selecting a saved advisor model that is blocked by the `availableModels` allowlist
- Fixed skill hot-reload re-sending the entire skill listing when a single skill changed; only changed skills are now re-announced
- Fixed Workflow tool `agent()` subagents missing per-agent attribution headers
- [VSCode] Added usage attribution to the Account & usage dialog (`/usage`) showing cache misses, long context, subagents, and per-skill/agent/plugin/MCP breakdowns over the last 24h or 7d
- Fixed pre-warmed background workers failing with "Could not resolve authentication method" when claimed after sitting idle

## 2.1.173

- Fixed Fable 5 model names with a `[1m]` suffix not being normalized — Fable 5 includes 1M context by default, so the suffix is now stripped automatically
- Fixed a spurious "sandbox dependencies missing" startup warning on Windows when sandbox was enabled in settings

## 2.1.172

- Sub-agents can now spawn their own sub-agents (up to 5 levels deep)
- Amazon Bedrock now reads the AWS region from `~/.aws` config files when `AWS_REGION` isn't set, matching AWS SDK precedence; `/status` shows where the region came from
- Added a search bar when browsing a marketplace's plugins in `/plugin`
- Added `model` attribute to the `claude_code.lines_of_code.count` OTEL metric
- Fixed sessions using 1M context without usage credits getting permanently stuck — the session now automatically compacts back under the standard context limit
- Fixed a repeating "an image in the conversation could not be processed and was removed" error when the conversation contained multiple images
- Fixed the agents view keeping a session under Working with a busy spinner for up to 30 seconds after the worker replied
- Fixed background agents potentially reading another directory's project settings (`.mcp.json` approvals, trust) when dispatched onto a pre-warmed worker
- Fixed background-session attach failing with EAUTH for sessions started on an older version after the daemon auto-updated
- Fixed a background sub-agent staying stuck as "active" in the agent panel after a nested agent it spawned was stopped
- Fixed `/model` suggestions in the `claude agents` dispatch input rendering with a misleading slash prefix and showing models disabled for your org
- Fixed `availableModels` restrictions not being applied to subagent model overrides, the agent dispatch model picker, and the advisor model
- Fixed `availableModels` allowlists hiding the `/model` picker's Opus and Sonnet 1M rows when entries use version-specific IDs like `claude-opus-4-8`
- Fixed the `/model` picker on Bedrock offering models the provider doesn't serve — selecting one silently switched the session model and lit the selection marker on multiple rows
- Fixed model IDs getting a doubled 1M-context suffix (e.g. `[1M][1m]`) when `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` already includes one
- Fixed `opusplan` model setting not shipping with 1M context in plan mode for entitled users; the `opusplan[1m]` workaround now also correctly switches to Opus in plan mode
- Fixed `WebFetch(domain:*.example.com)` wildcard domain rules never matching subdomains in allow, deny, and ask position, and file permission rules with mid-pattern wildcards (e.g. `Read(secrets-*/config.json)`) being rejected at startup
- Fixed up-arrow prompt history showing the main agent's prompts while a subagent's chat tab is open
- Fixed memory recall not finding mounted team memory stores (`CLAUDE_MEMORY_STORES`) in remote sessions
- Fixed workflow validation rejecting scripts whose prompt strings or comments merely mention `Date.now()`/`Math.random()`
- Disable mouse tracking on Windows consoles that don't fully support it
- Fixed the `/plugin` marketplace list losing its cursor after backing out of a long plugin list, and Esc from the plugin browser returning to the wrong tab
- Improved performance in long conversations by removing redundant message normalization and avoiding full message-history transforms when streaming tool-use state is unchanged
- Reduced idle CPU usage: `/goal` status chip no longer re-renders the terminal at 5 Hz while idle, and fewer UI re-renders while subagents run in parallel
- Improved Claude in Chrome tool loading: browser tools now load in a single batched call instead of one per tool
- Improved the non-interactive Usage Policy refusal message to suggest starting a new session or changing your model
- `/code-review` now keeps the `ultra` option visible when you're not signed in to claude.ai, with an explanation that the cloud review requires a claude.ai account
- Shortened the Remote Control footer indicator to "/rc active" and hid it on narrow terminals
- Stopped promoting `/loop` in remote sessions, where pending loops don't keep the container alive
- [VSCode] Fixed PowerShell tool calls rendering as raw JSON instead of a proper command display and permission dialog, and stripped ANSI escape codes from displayed shell output

## 2.1.170

- Introducing Claude Fable 5: a Mythos-class model that we’ve made safe for general use. Fable’s capabilities exceed those of any model we’ve ever made generally available. Update to version 2.1.170 for access. https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-fable-5-mythos-5
- Fixed sessions not saving transcripts (and not appearing in --resume) when launched from the VS Code integrated terminal or any shell that inherited Claude Code environment variables.

## 2.1.169

- Added `--safe-mode` flag (and `CLAUDE_CODE_SAFE_MODE`) to start Claude Code with all customizations (CLAUDE.md, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP servers) disabled for troubleshooting
- Added `/cd` command to move a session to a new working directory without breaking the prompt cache mid-session
- Added a `disableBundledSkills` setting and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS` environment variable to hide bundled skills, workflows, and built-in slash commands from the model
- Fixed Up/Down arrows jumping to command history past the wrapped rows of a long input line — they now move through each visual row first, and history recall enters at the near edge
- Fixed enterprise managed MCP policies (`allowedMcpServers`/`deniedMcpServers`) not being enforced on reconnect, IDE-typed configs, `--mcp-config` servers during the first session after install, or before remote settings loaded; also fixed slow cold starts for orgs without remote settings
- Fixed a ~30-50ms UI stall at the start of each turn for macOS users logged in with claude.ai credentials
- Fixed `claude -p` being slow or appearing to hang on Windows while waiting for the slash-command/skill scan (regression in 2.1.161)
- Fixed Remote Control getting stuck on "reconnecting" after resuming a session when an OAuth token refresh happened at the same time
- Fixed Git Credential Manager's "Connect to GitHub" popup appearing on Windows at startup when background git commands ran without cached credentials
- Fixed footer hints (e.g. "esc to interrupt") not showing for users with a custom statusline
- Fixed stale permission and dialog prompts reappearing every time you reattached to a remote session whose worker had died while waiting on them
- Fixed `claude agents --json` omitting blocked and just-dispatched background sessions; added `--all` to include completed sessions, plus new `id` and `state` fields
- Fixed agents view leaving a stale/garbled frame after navigating back from an agent on WSL in Windows Terminal
- Fixed background agents ignoring project-level settings `env` values (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`) when dispatched onto a pre-warmed worker
- Fixed MCPB plugin cache being spuriously invalidated on Windows, causing unnecessary re-extraction
- Fixed plugin `.in_use` PID lock files accumulating without bound; stale markers from crashed sessions are now swept once per day
- Fixed untrusted project settings being able to set OTEL client-certificate paths without trust confirmation
- `/workflows` now opens immediately even while a turn is in progress
- Improved `TaskCreate` reliability: malformed inputs are repaired automatically and validation errors for unloaded tools include the schema
- Improved the error message shown when your organization has disabled API key authentication, with guidance based on where the active API key comes from
- Reduced CPU usage while responses stream and during spinner animations
- Restored a default 5-minute idle timeout on Vertex/Foundry so a stalled stream aborts instead of hanging indefinitely; set `API_FORCE_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0` to opt out
- Remote-managed settings with an invalid entry now apply their remaining valid policies and surface the validation error, instead of silently dropping the whole payload
- Background sessions now preserve `--ide`, `--chrome`, `--bare`, `--remote-control`, and other flags across retire→wake, and respawn state validation was hardened
- Background sessions are now told that shared-checkout edits are blocked until they enter a worktree, avoiding a wasted rejected edit before `EnterWorktree`
- The "CLAUDE.md is too long" warning threshold now scales with the model's context window
- Auto-updater on Windows now stops retrying within a session once `claude.exe` is held by another process
- Improved color contrast for skill tags in the slash-command menu
- Promo credit claims for Apple/Google-billed subscribers without a payment method now explain where to add one
- Added a tip suggesting `claude agents` when running multiple concurrent sessions

## 2.1.168

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.167

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.166

- Added `fallbackModel` setting to configure up to three fallback models tried in order when the primary model is overloaded or unavailable; `--fallback-model` now also applies to interactive sessions
- Added glob pattern support in deny rule tool-name position (`"*"` denies all tools); allow rules reject non-MCP globs, and unknown tool names in deny rules warn at startup
- Hardened cross-session messaging: messages relayed via `SendMessage` from other Claude sessions no longer carry user authority — receivers refuse relayed permission requests, and auto mode blocks them
- `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`, `--thinking disabled`, and the per-model thinking toggle now disable thinking on models that think by default via the Claude API (3P providers unchanged)
- Claude Code now retries a turn once on the fallback model when the API rejects an unexpected non-retryable error; auth, rate-limit, request-size, and transport errors still surface immediately
- `claude update` now announces the target version before downloading instead of going silent
- `claude agents`: typing a URL into the list now filters to the session whose first prompt contained it
- Fixed a recurring "image could not be processed" error and extra token usage when an unprocessable image was sent in a session
- Fixed remote sessions becoming permanently stuck when a brief backend disruption occurred during worker registration at startup
- Fixed flickering in JetBrains IDE terminals (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.) on 2026.1+ by enabling synchronized output
- Fixed Shift+non-ASCII characters (e.g. Shift+ä → Ä) being dropped in terminals using the Kitty keyboard protocol (WezTerm, Ghostty, kitty)
- Fixed PowerShell command validation occasionally hanging far past its time budget on Windows when a killed process's children held its output pipes
- Fixed orphaned `claude --bg-pty-host` processes spinning at 100% CPU after the daemon dies while connected on macOS
- Fixed voice mode requiring `/login` to clear a stale auth check after toggling `/voice`
- Fixed managed settings with an invalid entry silently disabling enforcement of their remaining valid policies
- Fixed managed-settings `allowedMcpServers`/`deniedMcpServers` predicates not matching when they use `${VAR}` references
- Fixed background agent sessions that entered a git worktree crash-looping with "No conversation found" when reopened from `claude agents`
- Fixed duplicated thinking text in the Ctrl+O transcript view while streaming
- Fixed `/doctor` showing a contradictory failed "Not inside a remote session" check when run inside a remote session
- Fixed the cursor sticking at the end of the first line when typing a multiline prompt in the `claude agents` dispatch and reply inputs
- Fixed blank lines appearing between background agent rows in the task list on terminals without Unicode support

## 2.1.165

- Bug fixes and reliability improvements

## 2.1.163

- Added `requiredMinimumVersion` and `requiredMaximumVersion` managed settings — Claude Code refuses to start if its version is outside the allowed range and directs the user to an approved version
- Added `/plugin list` command to list installed plugins, with `--enabled`/`--disabled` filters
- Added a "c to copy" shortcut to `/btw` that copies the raw markdown answer to the clipboard, preserving formatting when pasted elsewhere
- Hooks: Stop and SubagentStop hooks can now return `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` to give Claude feedback and keep the turn going without being labeled a hook error
- Skills: added `\$` escape syntax to include a literal `$` before a digit in command bodies
- stdio MCP servers now receive the same `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` as hooks/Bash on `--resume`
- Fixed `claude -p` hanging forever after its final result when a backgrounded command never exits — background shells are now stopped ~5s after the result once stdin closes
- Fixed `claude -p` failing with "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required" on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry when `CI=true` and no Anthropic API key is set
- Fixed bash commands failing under bazel and EDR-protected Go workflows: `$TMPDIR` was overridden to `/tmp/claude-{uid}` for all commands instead of only sandboxed ones (regression in 2.1.154)
- Fixed Bash commands failing on Windows with "EEXIST: file already exists" on the session-env directory when it has the read-only attribute or is inside OneDrive
- Fixed org-managed permission rules not applying for the entire session when the managed settings fetch completed during startup on a fresh config directory
- Fixed background sessions in `claude agents` losing their running background tasks when reattached after a Claude Code update
- Fixed terminal misalignment and a multi-second hang when exiting the agent view by pressing Esc
- Fixed clicking Stop on a background-task chip in the desktop app not clearing the chip when the underlying process was already gone
- Fixed keyboard input becoming permanently unresponsive after a paste operation whose end marker is dropped by the terminal
- Fixed hook `if: "Bash(...)"` conditions firing on every Bash command containing `$()` or `$VAR`; the pattern now matches against commands inside subshells and backticks too
- Fixed deny rules on home-directory paths (e.g. `Read(~/Desktop/**)`) not blocking Bash commands that reference the path via `$HOME`
- Fixed a stray "(no content)" line left in the transcript after closing panel dialogs like /mcp and /plugins
- Background agent sessions now update to a new Claude Code version in the background, so opening a session after an update no longer waits on a cold restart
- Clearer descriptions for built-in commands and skills in the / menu
- The subscription-switch suggestion now shows in the startup announcement slot instead of a toast
- `claude agents` dispatching from the state-grouped view now starts the session in the directory the agent view was opened from

## 2.1.162

- `claude agents --json` now includes `waitingFor` showing what a waiting session is blocked on (e.g. permission prompt)
- `--tools`: explicitly listing Grep/Glob now provides the dedicated search tools on native builds with embedded search (previously these names were silently ignored)
- `/effort` now confirms when your chosen level will persist as the default for new sessions
- Clicking a slash command in the autocomplete menu now fills it into your prompt instead of running it immediately; press Enter to run
- Remote Control now shows as a persistent footer pill (with a link to the session) instead of a startup message
- Renamed Windsurf to Devin Desktop in the `/ide` menu, `/terminal-setup`, and `/scroll-speed`, following the editor's rebrand
- Fixed a silent startup hang when the config directory is read-only or unwritable — Claude Code now starts with in-memory config and surfaces startup errors instead of showing a blank screen
- Fixed WebFetch permission rules not being applied to built-in preapproved domains; explicit `WebFetch(domain:...)` deny/ask/allow rules now take precedence over the preapproved-host auto-allow
- Fixed Windows permission rules never matching when spelled with backslashes (`~\`, `\\server\share`) or case-variant paths, and Read deny rules not hiding files from Glob/Grep results
- Fixed an interrupt (Esc) sent at the very start of a turn being silently dropped in stream-json/SDK sessions, leaving the turn running with no "Interrupted" feedback
- Fixed API 400 `no low surrogate in string` errors for classifier side-queries and MCP server descriptions containing emoji near a truncation boundary
- Fixed MCP per-server `timeout` config values below 1000 ms being floored to a 1-second watchdog that aborted every tool call; sub-1000 ms values are now ignored (falling back to `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` or default), and `claude mcp get` annotates them accordingly
- Fixed the LSP tool's `workspaceSymbol` operation returning no results; it now accepts a `query` parameter and passes it to the language server
- Fixed `claude agents` cutting live status text (tool args, replies, prompts, exec output) at 60–120 columns on wide terminals; the status detail now uses the full terminal width
- Fixed `claude agents` truncating long session names at 40 columns; the name column now grows with terminal width
- Fixed `claude agents` attach occasionally bouncing straight back to the session list on the first try after a background-service restart
- Fixed `claude agents` Ctrl+V image paste doing nothing in the dispatch input and the session reply box; pasting with no image now shows a hint
- Fixed backgrounding a session with ← silently losing the conversation when the background service cannot start; the session stays in the list as a failed row you can wake with Enter
- Fixed replies from the agents view that fail to send being lost; they are now queued for delivery on the next session start
- Fixed cross-session messaging (`SendMessage`) silently breaking when `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` or `$TMPDIR` points at a deep directory

- Quieter startup: notices group by severity, and session info and announcements share a single line per launch
- Startup warnings rewritten to be shorter and clearer, each with a concrete fix
- Launch-prompt warnings (deep link/pre-filled prompt) now stay pinned below the input until you act instead of scrolling away
- Failed turns now show a compact warning line instead of a multi-line red error block
- Improved background service startup and `claude update` verification to wait out endpoint-security scanning of new binaries instead of failing after 5 seconds

- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` values are now included as labels on metric datapoints, so you can slice usage metrics by custom dimensions like team or repo
- `claude agents` rows now show `done/total` before the detail when work is fanned out; peek shows the longest-running item
- `/mcp` now collapses claude.ai connectors you've never signed in to behind a "Show unused connectors" row
- Parallel tool calls: a failed Bash command no longer cancels other calls in the same batch — each tool returns its own result independently
- Fullscreen mode: clipboard now uses `wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel` on Linux when available, copies to both the clipboard and PRIMARY selection for middle-click paste, and the "hold {key} for native selection" hint now shows the correct key per terminal

- Fixed OpenTelemetry log events (`user_prompt`, `api_request`, `tool_result`, `tool_decision`) being silently dropped when emitted before telemetry initialization completed
- Fixed `claude mcp` list/get/add printing secrets to the terminal: `${VAR}` references are no longer expanded, and credential headers and URL secrets are redacted
- Fixed Workflow agents spawned with `isolation: "worktree"` in background sessions being blocked from editing files inside their own worktree
- Fixed background sessions dispatched from `claude agents` booting on a stale model from the daemon's environment instead of the model in `settings.json`
- Fixed a potential crash when rendering Write tool results after resuming a session
- Fixed completed subagents getting stuck showing as running when an error occurs while finalizing their result

- Improved terminal rendering performance by stabilizing the layout engine's JIT compilation profile
- Improved rendering performance for large file writes
- [VSCode] Added a tip suggesting disabling terminal GPU acceleration (or running `/terminal-setup`) to fix garbled glyphs

## 2.1.160

- Added a prompt before writing to shell startup files (`.zshenv`, `.zlogin`, `.bash_login`) and `~/.config/git/`, which could otherwise lead to unintended command execution
- `acceptEdits` mode now prompts before writing build-tool config files that grant code execution (`.npmrc`, `.yarnrc*`, `bunfig.toml`, `.bazelrc`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.devcontainer/`, etc.)
- Edit no longer requires a separate Read after viewing a file with `grep`: single-file `grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep` commands now satisfy the read-before-edit check
- Fixed copy-on-select not writing to the Windows clipboard on WSL — now uses PowerShell interop instead of OSC 52, which terminals like MobaXterm don't support
- Fixed restoring a completed session from `claude agents` dropping chat history and re-running the original prompt
- Fixed background sessions re-attached after overnight retire losing their conversation and re-running the original prompt

- Fixed Claude's past replies disappearing from scrollback when resuming a brief mode session with brief mode turned off
- Fixed vim mode `p` pasting on the line below instead of at the cursor when the register was yanked with `v$`
- Improved performance of opening recently-inactive background agent sessions in `claude agents`
- Improved auto mode classifier latency by reducing reasoning on routine actions, lowering the chance of "could not evaluate this action" blocks
- Improved background-session teardown (`claude rm`/`stop`, idle reap) to send SIGTERM to running shell subprocesses before SIGKILL, so cleanup handlers run

- Fixed `--worktree` and `--worktree --tmux` returning to the canonical repo root instead of the current linked worktree
- Fixed the `/model` picker showing an incorrect "Newer version available" hint when the selected model is already the newest in its family; the pinned-model row now shows the model's description instead of its raw ID

## 2.1.154

- Opus 4.8 is here! Now defaults to high effort · /effort xhigh for your hardest tasks

- Fixed API 400 errors on models that don't support the effort parameter when `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` is set
- Windows: Fixed update failures caused by `claude.exe` being in use showing a generic error instead of telling you to close other sessions and retry
- Removed the stale "& for background" hint from the shortcuts help panel
- [VSCode] Auto mode no longer requires the bypass-permissions setting to appear in the mode picker, and a dismissable notice on the new-session screen explains auto mode the first time it's active

- [VSCode] Fixed Claude Code processes not shutting down cleanly when VS Code closed on Windows, causing false "unclean exit" reports and orphaned MCP servers
- `/model` now saves your selection as the default for new sessions (matching the IDE). Press `s` in the picker to switch models for the current session only.
- If you customized the `modelPicker:setAsDefault` keybinding, rename it to `modelPicker:thisSessionOnly` in keybindings.json (the `d` action was replaced by `s`)

## 2.1.152

- `/code-review --fix` now applies review findings to your working tree after the review, surfacing reuse, simplification, and efficiency suggestions; `/simplify` now invokes `/code-review --fix`

- Enterprise: added the `allowAllClaudeAiMcps` managed setting to load claude.ai cloud MCP connectors alongside `managed-mcp.json`
- Fixed a PowerShell permission bypass: built-in `cd` functions (`cd..`, `cd\`, `cd~`, `X:`) changed the working directory undetected, letting a later command read outside the workspace
- Fixed the sandbox write allowlist in git worktrees covering the entire main repository root instead of only the shared `.git` directory (with `hooks/` and `config` denied)
- Fixed PowerShell prefix/wildcard allow rules (e.g. `PowerShell(dotnet.exe build *)`) not pre-approving native executables and scripts
- Fixed a permission-analysis gap where the parser trusted stale variable-tracking values for `PWD`/`OLDPWD`/`DIRSTACK` across `cd`/`pushd`/`popd`

## 2.1.147

- Pinned background sessions (`Ctrl+T` in `claude agents`) now stay alive when idle, are restarted in place to apply Claude Code updates, and are shed under memory pressure only after non-pinned sessions
- Renamed `/simplify` to `/code-review`. It now reports correctness bugs at a chosen effort level (e.g., `/code-review high`); pass `--comment` to post findings as inline GitHub PR comments. The old cleanup-and-fix behavior has been removed
- Improved auto-updater: retries transient network failures, reports specific error categories and OS error codes on failure, and shows the current version when an update fails
- Improved diff rendering performance for large file edits
- Prompt history no longer records consecutive duplicate entries — recalling a prompt with arrow-up and submitting it again won't add another copy
- Fixed enterprise login restrictions (`forceLoginOrgUUID` and `forceLoginMethod` managed-settings) not being enforced against third-party-provider and API-key sessions
- Fixed `&` in `!` command output displaying as `&amp;`, which broke copy-pasting URLs from commands like `gcloud auth login` on headless machines

- Fixed an uncaught exception at the end of streaming sessions when running via the Agent SDK
- Fixed a rare hang when waiting for scroll to settle on Windows

- Fixed stripped images prompting the model to repeatedly re-read media that was no longer present

## 2.1.145

- Added `claude agents --json` to list live Claude sessions as JSON for scripting (tmux-resurrect, status bars, session pickers)
- Added `agent_id` and `parent_agent_id` attributes to `claude_code.tool` OTEL spans, and fixed trace parenting so background subagent spans nest under the dispatching Agent tool span
- Status line JSON input now includes GitHub repo and PR information when detected
- `/plugin` Discover and Browse screens now show a plugin's commands, agents, skills, hooks, and MCP/LSP servers before installation

- Improved the Read tool to return a truncated first page with a "PARTIAL view" notice instead of a hard error when a whole-file read exceeds the token limit

## 2.1.144

- Added `/resume` support for background sessions — sessions started via `claude --bg` or agent view now appear alongside interactive ones, marked with `bg`
- Added elapsed duration to background subagent completion notifications (e.g. "Agent completed · 3h 2m 5s")
- The `/plugin` browse and discover panes now show when a plugin was last updated
- `/model` now changes the model for the current session only; press `d` in the model picker to set a default for new sessions
- Renamed "extra usage" to "usage credits" across CLI copy; `/extra-usage` is now `/usage-credits` (old name still works)
- Fixed startup hanging up to 75s when `api.anthropic.com` is unreachable (captive portal, firewall, VPN issues) — side-channel API calls now time out after 15s
- Fixed garbled terminal output after a missed window-resize event (e.g. dragging a VS Code split-pane divider) — now self-heals on the next frame instead of requiring Ctrl+L
- Fixed progressive terminal display corruption (stale/garbled glyphs) that could appear in very long sessions and only cleared on terminal resize or restart
- Reduced terminal rendering glitches in VS Code by reducing spinner animation color count
- Fixed macOS background sessions crashing with "exit 1 before init" when the project lives under a Full Disk Access-protected folder (regression in 2.1.143)
- Fixed an unrecoverable conversation when reading a file whose image extension doesn't match its contents (e.g. HTML saved as .png) — now falls back to text
- Fewer spurious tool errors during search: `head`/`tail` file views now satisfy the read-before-edit check, and a "no matches" result (exit code 1) from `egrep`, `fgrep`, `git grep`, or `git diff` is no longer reported as a command failure
- Fixed `/branch` failing with "No conversation to branch" after entering a worktree or in some background sessions
- Fixed pressing Escape in the AskUserQuestion notes field aborting the turn instead of returning to answer selection
- Fixed model selection not applying when changed via the IDE model picker or `applyFlagSettings` after startup

- Fixed file descriptor exhaustion when a build runs inside a skill directory — non-`.md` files no longer trigger skill reloads
- Fixed session title being generated from plugin monitor output instead of the user's first prompt
- Fixed Skill tool failing with permission error in headless mode (regression in v2.1.141)
- Fixed plugins enabled in your own settings showing "not cached" errors after first load on a fresh machine; plugins enabled only by a project's `.claude/settings.json` now show an actionable `claude plugin install` hint
- Fixed `claude mcp list` silently reporting no servers when `.mcp.json` can't be parsed (e.g. using VS Code's `"servers"` key instead of `"mcpServers"`) — now shows configuration errors
- Fixed background side-queries on custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` setups and Bedrock Mantle not using Haiku — now falls back correctly when a first-party API key is configured or no Haiku model is set

- Fixed background Bash tasks spawned by subagents staying "Running" in SDK task panels after the process exits
- Fixed completed or stopped background sessions briefly failing to wake being permanently marked as a startup crash
- Fixed markdown links in `claude agents` attached sessions rendering as plain text instead of clickable hyperlinks
- Fixed custom `spinnerVerbs` applying to the post-turn duration message — past-tense built-ins like "Worked for 5s" are restored there

- `claude --bg --name <label>` now echoes the name in the post-spawn confirmation
- `claude agents`: renaming a background session with Ctrl+R now updates the attached session's banner immediately

- `/plugin` now returns to the Installed list after enabling, disabling, or uninstalling a plugin
- `/doctor` now shows an exec-form example when a command hook is missing the `command` field
- Skill-listing truncation is no longer shown as a startup notification — run `/doctor` for the full breakdown
- Improved recovery from rare pre-response stream stalls — now retries streaming once instead of falling back to a slower non-streaming request
- Improved SDK/headless MCP startup: pre-wait now overlaps startup instead of blocking before the first turn (up to 2s faster with slow MCP servers)
- The post-survey follow-up hint now appears after every non-dismiss survey response with context-aware copy, making it easier to share more detail via /feedback.

## 2.1.143

- Added plugin dependency enforcement: `claude plugin disable` now refuses when another enabled plugin depends on the target (with a copy-pasteable disable-chain hint), and `claude plugin enable` force-enables transitive dependencies
- Added projected context cost (per-turn and per-invocation token estimates) to the `/plugin` marketplace browse pane
- Added `worktree.bgIsolation: "none"` setting to let background sessions edit the working copy directly without `EnterWorktree`, for repos where worktrees are impractical
- PowerShell tool now passes `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`. Opt out with `CLAUDE_CODE_POWERSHELL_RESPECT_EXECUTION_POLICY=1`
- Background sessions now preserve the model and effort level you set after waking from idle
- Shift+Tab in attached agent sessions now includes auto mode in the cycle
- Fixed a corrupt `.credentials.json` with a non-array `scopes` value hanging the CLI on startup or silently aborting OAuth token refresh

- `claude agents` now accepts `--add-dir`, `--settings`, `--mcp-config`, and `--plugin-dir` and applies them to the dashboard and to background sessions dispatched from it
- `claude agents` accepts `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--effort`, and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to set defaults for sessions dispatched from the view
- `claude --bg --dangerously-skip-permissions` now persists across retire→wake
- Fixed background sessions silently capturing IDE file references into the warm spare's input, which caused the reference to be prepended to the next prompt dispatched from `claude agents`
- Worktree cleanup no longer falls back to `rm -rf` when `git worktree remove` fails, preventing loss of gitignored or in-progress files
- Fixed background-job sessions on macOS getting "Operation not permitted" errors when reading files under `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop`, or `~/Downloads`, even with Full Disk Access granted.
- `/bg` now preserves `--mcp-config`, `--settings`, `--add-dir`, `--plugin-dir`, and `--strict-mcp-config`, so backgrounded sessions keep their MCP servers and settings across respawn.
- Background sessions launched from `claude agents` now honor `permissions.defaultMode` from settings.json (was previously overridden to auto mode)
- Fixed: on Windows, pressing ← in `claude agents` while a response was streaming could leave the agents list unresponsive to all input
- `/bg` and `←`-detach now preserve `--fallback-model`, so backgrounded workers degrade to the fallback model on overload instead of hard-failing.
- `/bg` and `←`-detach now preserve `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`, so the forked worker keeps bypass-permissions available in its Shift+Tab cycle.
- Fixed: background daemon spawn now falls back to the running binary when the `~/.local/bin/claude` launcher is missing or non-executable
- Fixed `claude agents --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` defaulting dispatched sessions to bypass mode instead of making it available in the permission cycle

## 2.1.142

- Fixed `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` not raising the per-request fetch timeout for remote HTTP and SSE MCP servers, which capped tool calls at 60 seconds regardless of the configured value
- Fixed background sessions not recognizing pre-existing git worktrees, blocking Edit while EnterWorktree refused to create a duplicate
- Fixed background sessions disappearing and daemon reconnect failing after macOS sleep/wake — the daemon now detects clock jumps instead of treating them as elapsed idle time

- Removed stale `/model claude-sonnet-4-20250514` suggestion from Usage Policy refusal messages

## 2.1.141

## 2.1.133

- Added `worktree.baseRef` setting (`fresh` | `head`) to choose whether `--worktree`, `EnterWorktree`, and agent-isolation worktrees branch from `origin/<default>` or local `HEAD`. **Note:** the default `fresh` changes `EnterWorktree`'s base back to `origin/<default>` (it has been local `HEAD` since 2.1.128) — set `worktree.baseRef: "head"` to keep unpushed commits in new worktrees
- Added `sandbox.bwrapPath` and `sandbox.socatPath` managed settings (Linux/WSL) to specify custom bubblewrap and socat binary locations
- Added `parentSettingsBehavior` admin-tier key (`'first-wins' | 'merge'`) to let admins opt SDK `managedSettings` (parent tier) into the policy merge

- Fixed Read/Write/Edit being denied on mapped network drives passed via `--add-dir` / SDK `additionalDirectories`
- Fixed Remote Control stop/interrupt from claude.ai not fully canceling the CLI session the same way local Esc does, causing queued messages to never advance after interrupting a stuck tool or prompt

- `claude --help` now lists `--remote-control` alongside `--remote-control-session-name-prefix`
- [VSCode] Fixed `claudeCode.claudeProcessWrapper` failing with "Unsupported platform" when the extension build doesn't bundle a Claude binary

## 2.1.132

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` environment variable to the Bash tool subprocess environment, matching the `session_id` passed to hooks

- Added a "Pasting…" footer hint while a Ctrl+V image paste is being read from the clipboard
- Fixed external SIGINT (e.g. IDE stop button, `kill -INT`) not running graceful shutdown — terminal modes are now restored and the `--resume` hint is printed instead of an abrupt exit
- Fixed an uncaught exception when the terminal is closed or SSH disconnects mid-session under the native build
- Fixed `--resume` failing with `no low surrogate in string` when a tool error truncation split an emoji; pre-corrupted sessions are sanitized on load

- Updated `/model` picker: collapsed duplicate Opus 4.7 entries, and current Opus now shows as "Opus" instead of "Opus 4.7"
- Subprocesses (Bash, hooks, MCP, LSP) no longer inherit `OTEL_*` environment variables, so OTEL-instrumented apps run via the Bash tool no longer pick up the CLI's own OTLP endpoint
- MCP: `workspace` is now a reserved server name — existing servers with that name will be skipped with a warning
- Reconnecting MCP servers no longer flood the conversation with full tool-name lists on every reconnect — re-announced tools are summarized by server prefix
- SDK hosts now receive a persistent `localSettings` suggestion for Bash permission prompts, so "Always allow" writes to `.claude/settings.local.json`
- `EnterWorktree` now creates the new branch from local HEAD as documented, instead of `origin/<default-branch>` — unpushed commits are no longer dropped
- Auto mode: when the classifier can't evaluate an action, the error now includes a hint (retry, `/compact`, or run with `--debug`)
- Fixed focus mode briefly dimming the previous response when submitting a new prompt
- Fixed stray "4;0;" desktop notification on every `/exit` in Kitty and other terminals that interpret OSC 9 as a notification

- Fixed markdown link labels being lost on terminals without OSC 8 hyperlink support — links now render as `label (url)` instead of just the URL
- Fixed sessions on 1M-context models with a smaller autocompact window being falsely blocked with "Prompt is too long" before reaching the actual API limit
- Fixed parallel shell tool calls: a failing read-only command (grep, git diff, ls) no longer cancels sibling calls
- Fixed banner showing "with X effort" on models that don't support effort
- Fixed `/fast` on 3P providers fuzzy-matching to an unrelated skill instead of showing "not available"
- Fixed Bedrock default model resolving to `global.*` instead of the region-appropriate prefix

- Fixed pasting an image larger than 2000px breaking the session — images are now downscaled on paste, and oversized images in history are automatically removed and the request retried
- Fixed showing the login screen for "OAuth not allowed for organization" errors — now shows guidance to contact your admin
- Fixed OAuth login failing with timeout on slow or proxied connections, in IPv6-only devcontainers, and when the browser callback can't reach localhost

Custom/MCP command names are redacted unless `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS=1` is set
- Native builds on macOS and Linux: the `Glob` and `Grep` tools are replaced by embedded `bfs` and `ugrep` available through the Bash tool — faster searches without a separate tool round-trip (Windows and npm-installed builds unchanged)

## 2.1.116

- `/resume` on large sessions is significantly faster (up to 67% on 40MB+ sessions) and handles sessions with many dead-fork entries more efficiently
- Faster MCP startup when multiple stdio servers are configured; `resources/templates/list` is now deferred to first `@`-mention
- Smoother fullscreen scrolling in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf terminals — `/terminal-setup` now configures the editor's scroll sensitivity

- Fixed terminal display tearing (random characters, drifting input) in iTerm2 + tmux setups when terminal notifications are sent
- Fixed `@` file suggestions re-scanning the entire project on every turn in non-git working directories, and showing only config files in freshly-initialized git repos with no tracked files

- Added recap feature to provide context when returning to a session, configurable in `/config` and manually invocable with `/recap`; force with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AWAY_SUMMARY` if telemetry disabled.
- The model can now discover and invoke built-in slash commands like `/init`, `/review`, and `/security-review` via the Skill tool
- `/undo` is now an alias for `/rewind`

- Improved `/resume` picker to default to sessions from the current directory; press `Ctrl+A` to show all projects
- Improved error messages: server rate limits are now distinguished from plan usage limits; 5xx/529 errors show a link to status.claude.com; unknown slash commands suggest the closest match

- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CRON` environment variable to immediately stop scheduled cron jobs mid-session
- Added `lsof`, `pgrep`, `tput`, `ss`, `fd`, and `fdfind` to the bash auto-approval allowlist, reducing permission prompts for common read-only operations
- Restored the `model` parameter on the Agent tool for per-invocation model overrides
- Simplified effort levels to low/medium/high (removed max) with new symbols (○ ◐ ●) and a brief notification instead of a persistent icon. Use `/effort auto` to reset to default

- Added support for marketplace git URLs without `.git` suffix (Azure DevOps, AWS CodeCommit)
- Improved marketplace clone failure messages to show diagnostic info even when git produces no stderr
- Fixed several plugin issues: installation failing on Windows with `EEXIST` error in OneDrive folders, marketplace blocking user-scope installs when a project-scope install exists, `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` creating literal `~` directories, and `plugin.json` with marketplace-only fields failing to load
- Fixed feedback survey appearing too frequently in long sessions
- Fixed `--effort` CLI flag being reset by unrelated settings writes on startup
- Fixed backgrounded Ctrl+B queries losing their transcript or corrupting the new conversation after `/clear`
- Fixed `/clear` killing background agent/bash tasks — only foreground tasks are now cleared

- Fixed "Always Allow" saving permission rules that never match again
- Fixed several hooks issues: `transcript_path` pointing to the wrong directory for resumed/forked sessions, agent `prompt` being silently deleted from settings.json on every settings write, PostToolUse block reason displaying twice, async hooks not receiving stdin with bash `read -r`, and validation error message showing an example that fails validation

- VSCode: Fixed scroll speed in integrated terminals not matching native terminals
- VSCode: Fixed Shift+Enter submitting input instead of inserting a newline for users with older keybindings
- VSCode: Added effort level indicator on the input border
- VSCode: Added `vscode://anthropic.claude-code/open` URI handler to open a new Claude Code tab programmatically, with optional `prompt` and `session` query parameters

## 2.1.71

- Added `/loop` command to run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`)
- Added cron scheduling tools for recurring prompts within a session
- Added `voice:pushToTalk` keybinding to make the voice activation key rebindable in `keybindings.json` (default: space) — modifier+letter combos like `meta+k` have zero typing interference
- Added `fmt`, `comm`, `cmp`, `numfmt`, `expr`, `test`, `printf`, `getconf`, `seq`, `tsort`, and `pr` to the bash auto-approval allowlist
- Fixed stdin freeze in long-running sessions where keystrokes stop being processed but the process stays alive

- Fixed prompting for `cd <cwd> && git ...` on Windows when the model uses a mingw-style path
- Improved startup time by deferring native image processor loading to first use
- Improved bridge session reconnection to complete within seconds after laptop wake from sleep, instead of waiting up to 10 minutes
- Improved `/plugin uninstall` to disable project-scoped plugins in `.claude/settings.local.json` instead of modifying `.claude/settings.json`, so changes don't affect teammates
- Improved plugin-provided MCP server deduplication — servers that duplicate a manually-configured server (same command/URL) are now skipped, preventing duplicate connections and tool sets. Suppressions are shown in the `/plugin` menu.
- Updated `/debug` to toggle debug logging on mid-session, since debug logs are no longer written by default
- Removed startup notification noise for unauthenticated org-registered claude.ai connectors

## 2.1.70

- Fixed API 400 errors when using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with a third-party gateway — tool search now correctly detects proxy endpoints and disables `tool_reference` blocks
- Fixed `API Error: 400 This model does not support the effort parameter` when using custom Bedrock inference profiles or other model identifiers not matching standard Claude naming patterns
- Fixed empty model responses immediately after `ToolSearch` — the server renders tool schemas with system-prompt-style tags at the prompt tail, which could confuse models into stopping early
- Fixed prompt-cache bust when an MCP server with `instructions` connects after the first turn
- Fixed Enter inserting a newline instead of submitting when typing over a slow SSH connection
- Fixed clipboard corrupting non-ASCII text (CJK, emoji) on Windows/WSL by using PowerShell `Set-Clipboard`

- Fixed a performance regression in the `AskUserQuestion` preview dialog that re-ran markdown rendering on every keystroke in the notes input
- Fixed feature flags read during early startup never refreshing their disk cache, causing stale values to persist across sessions
- Fixed `permissions.defaultMode` settings values other than `acceptEdits` or `plan` being applied in Claude Code Remote environments — they are now ignored
- Fixed skill listing being re-injected on every `--resume` (~600 tokens saved per resume)
- Fixed teleport marker not rendering in VS Code teleported sessions
- Improved error message when microphone captures silence to distinguish from "no speech detected"
- Improved compaction to preserve images in the summarizer request, allowing prompt cache reuse for faster and cheaper compaction
- Improved `/rename` to work while Claude is processing, instead of being silently queued
- Reduced prompt input re-renders during turns by ~74%
- Reduced startup memory by ~426KB for users without custom CA certificates
- Reduced Remote Control `/poll` rate to once per 10 minutes while connected (was 1–2s), cutting server load ~300×. Reconnection is unaffected — transport loss immediately wakes fast polling.
- [VSCode] Added spark icon in VS Code activity bar that lists all Claude Code sessions, with sessions opening as full editors
- [VSCode] Added full markdown document view for plans in VS Code, with support for adding comments to provide feedback
- [VSCode] Added native MCP server management dialog — use `/mcp` in the chat panel to enable/disable servers, reconnect, and manage OAuth authentication without switching to the terminal

- Fixed `--model claude-opus-4-0` and `--model claude-opus-4-1` resolving to deprecated Opus versions instead of current
- Fixed macOS keychain corruption when using multiple OAuth MCP servers. Large OAuth metadata blobs could overflow the `security -i` stdin buffer, silently leaving stale credentials behind and causing repeated `/login` prompts.
- Fixed `.credentials.json` losing `subscriptionType` (showing "Claude API" instead of "Claude Pro"/"Claude Max") when the profile endpoint transiently fails during token refresh (anthropics/claude-code#30185)

- Fixed teammates accidentally spawning nested teammates via the Agent tool's `name` parameter
- Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` being ignored during conversation compaction
- Fixed `/compact` summary rendering as a user bubble in SDK consumers (Claude Code Remote web UI, VSCode extension)
- Fixed voice space bar getting stuck after a failed voice activation (module loading race, cold GrowthBook)
- Fixed worktree file copy on Windows
- Fixed global `.claude` folder detection on Windows
- Fixed symlink bypass where writing new files through a symlinked parent directory could escape the working directory in `acceptEdits` mode
- Fixed sandbox prompting users to approve non-allowed domains when `allowManagedDomainsOnly` is enabled in managed settings — non-allowed domains are now blocked automatically with no bypass
- Fixed interactive tools (e.g., `AskUserQuestion`) being silently auto-allowed when listed in a skill's allowed-tools, bypassing the permission prompt and running with empty answers
- Fixed multi-GB memory spike when committing with large untracked binary files in the working tree
- Fixed Escape not interrupting a running turn when the input box has draft text. Use Up arrow to pull queued messages back for editing, or Ctrl+U to clear the input line.
- Fixed Android app crash when running local slash commands (`/voice`, `/cost`) in Remote Control sessions
- Fixed a memory leak where old message array versions accumulated in React Compiler `memoCache` over long sessions
- Fixed a memory leak where REPL render scopes accumulated over long sessions (~35MB over 1000 turns)

- Fixed a memory leak in interactive mode where hook events could accumulate unboundedly during long sessions
- Fixed hang when `--mcp-config` points to a corrupted file
- Fixed slow startup when many skills/plugins are installed
- Fixed `cd <outside-dir> && <cmd>` permission prompt to surface the chained command instead of only showing "Yes, allow reading from <dir>/"
- Fixed conditional `.claude/rules/*.md` files (with `paths:` frontmatter) and nested CLAUDE.md files not loading in print mode (`claude -p`)

- Fixed Tab/arrow keys not cycling Settings tabs when `/config` search box is focused but empty
- Fixed service key OAuth sessions (CCR containers) spamming `[ERROR]` logs with 403s from profile-scoped endpoints
- Fixed inconsistent color for "Remote Control active" status indicator
- Fixed Voice waveform cursor covering the first suffix letter when dictating mid-input
- Fixed Voice input showing all 5 spaces during warmup instead of capping at ~2 (aligning with the "keep holding…" hint)
- Improved spinner performance by isolating the 50ms animation loop from the surrounding shell, reducing render and CPU overhead during turns
- Improved UI rendering performance in native binaries with React Compiler
- Improved `--worktree` startup by eliminating a git subprocess on the startup path
- Improved macOS startup by eliminating redundant settings-file reloads when managed settings resolve
- Improved macOS startup for Claude.ai enterprise/team users by skipping an unnecessary keychain lookup
- Improved MCP `-p` startup by pipelining claude.ai config fetch with local connections and using a concurrency pool instead of sequential batching
- Improved voice startup by removing imperceptible warmup pulse animations that were causing re-render stutter
- Improved MCP binary content handling: tools returning PDFs, Office documents, or audio now save decoded bytes to disk with the correct file extension instead of dumping raw base64 into the conversation context. WebFetch also saves binary responses alongside its summary.

- Improved LSP tool rendering and memory context building to no longer read entire files
- Improved session upload and memory sync to avoid reading large files into memory before size/binary checks
- Improved file operation performance by avoiding reading file contents for existence checks (6 sites)

- [VSCode] Added compaction display as a collapsible "Compacted chat" card with the summary inside
- [VSCode] The permission mode picker now respects `permissions.disableBypassPermissionsMode` from your effective Claude Code settings (including managed/policy settings) — when set to `disable`, bypass permissions mode is hidden from the picker
- [VSCode] Fixed RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian) rendering reversed in the chat panel (regression in v2.1.63)

## 2.1.68

- Opus 4.6 now defaults to medium effort for Max and Team subscribers. Medium effort works well for most tasks — it's the sweet spot between speed and thoroughness. You can change this anytime with `/model`
- Re-introduced the "ultrathink" keyword to enable high effort for the next turn
- Removed Opus 4 and 4.1 from Claude Code on the first-party API — users with these models pinned are automatically moved to Opus 4.6

- Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction
- Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently
- Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction
- Added "Always copy full response" option to the `/copy` picker. When selected, future `/copy` commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.
- VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list
- Fixed `/clear` not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation

## 2.1.62

- Added `/copy` command to show an interactive picker when code blocks are present, allowing selection of individual code blocks or the full response.
- Improved "always allow" prefix suggestions for compound bash commands (e.g. `cd /tmp && git fetch && git push`) to compute smarter per-subcommand prefixes instead of treating the whole command as one
- Improved ordering of short task lists
- Improved memory usage in multi-agent sessions by releasing completed subagent task state
- Fixed MCP OAuth token refresh race condition when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously
- Fixed shell commands not showing a clear error message when the working directory has been deleted

## 2.1.56

- VS Code: Fixed another cause of "command 'claude-vscode.editor.openLast' not found" crashes

## 2.1.55

- Fixed BashTool failing on Windows with EINVAL error

## 2.1.53

- Fixed a UI flicker where user input would briefly disappear after submission before the message rendered

- Added support for custom npm registries and specific version pinning when installing plugins from npm sources
- BashTool now skips login shell (`-l` flag) by default when a shell snapshot is available, improving command execution performance. Previously this required setting `CLAUDE_BASH_NO_LOGIN=true`.
- Fixed a security issue where `statusLine` and `fileSuggestion` hook commands could execute without workspace trust acceptance in interactive mode.
- Tool results larger than 50K characters are now persisted to disk (previously 100K). This reduces context window usage and improves conversation longevity.
- Fixed a bug where duplicate `control_response` messages (e.g. from WebSocket reconnects) could cause API 400 errors by pushing duplicate assistant messages into the conversation.
- Added `CLAUDE_CODE_ACCOUNT_UUID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_ORGANIZATION_UUID` environment variables for SDK callers to provide account info synchronously, eliminating a race condition where early telemetry events lacked account metadata.
- Fixed slash command autocomplete crashing when a plugin's SKILL.md description is a YAML array or other non-string type
- The `/model` picker now shows human-readable labels (e.g., "Sonnet 4.5") instead of raw model IDs for pinned model versions, with an upgrade hint when a newer version is available.
- Managed settings can now be set via macOS plist or Windows Registry. Learn more at https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#settings-files

- Added `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hook events, enabling custom VCS setup and teardown when agent worktree isolation creates or removes worktrees.
- Fixed a bug where resumed sessions could be invisible when the working directory involved symlinks, because the session storage path was resolved at different times during startup. Also fixed session data loss on SSH disconnect by flushing session data before hooks and analytics in the graceful shutdown sequence.
- Linux: Fixed native modules not loading on systems with glibc older than 2.30 (e.g., RHEL 8)
- Fixed memory leak in agent teams where completed teammate tasks were never garbage collected from session state
